# CLAUDE.md

`AGENTS.md` points here. The project specializes Project Context and copies Methodology Contract except starter-only entries. Hard rules govern both.

## Hard rules — read these before any action


These rules govern every action in this repo. They are placed above both zones so an agent reads them before doing anything irreversible. The full policy text for each is in `policies/`; consult that before bending the rule. Both hard rules are universal and retained from the template.

1. **Deliver gate-proved work; the user owns judgment and the destructive git surface.** Once a phase closes with every gate green, the orchestrator commits and fast-forward-pushes it; outside phases, a change is committed locally once the checks it could break pass, and one full gate on the exact tree qualifies the push — staging only its explicit paths (never `git add -A` or `git add .`, since this checkout may be shared), re-verifying the live tree and staged diff, and checking the resulting commit against the intended file list, with no agent credit and never `--no-verify`. Everything else stays the user's: `git tag`, `git reset --hard`, `git branch -D`, `git rebase`, `git checkout --`, `git clean -fd`, force-pushing, creating or selecting a remote, and any history rewrite. An unexpected path in `git status`, a shared file whose hunks cannot be attributed safely, an **unresolved** hook refusal, a missing or ambiguous upstream, a rejected push, divergence, or residual dirt **parks delivery** — report it and wait; never work around it. A hook refusal whose cause the diagnostic names, whose defect is in the agent's own work, and whose correction is safe and already authorized is work to finish: correct it, rerun the rejecting check against the staged content, renew every gate whose candidate moved, and retry with all hooks enabled — never disable, bypass, weaken or conceal a hook, and never retry unchanged input. **Delivery is not acceptance.** Manual, perceptual, product, and custody criteria — and the phase's `User Demo:` protocol — stay open for the user *after* the work is delivered, and the orchestrator never claims them. What does block a phase from closing at all is an unresolved *gate*: a failed build gate, an unmet executable criterion, an open `DECIDE` ripple. Full policies: [`policies/human-in-the-loop.md`](policies/human-in-the-loop.md) and [`policies/commit-staging.md`](policies/commit-staging.md).

2. **Greenfield until released: no backward-compatibility code.** Do not write legacy aliases, `@deprecated` markers, schema migrations to read older formats, transitional code paths, version-conditional branches, or "compat" shims of any kind. When an earlier shape turns out wrong, replace it directly and update every call site, fixture, test, sample data file, brief, plan, and doc in the same phase. This rule ends only when the project ships a stable external release and explicitly amends the policy. Full policy: [`policies/greenfield-until-released.md`](policies/greenfield-until-released.md).

If the user explicitly restricts or waives one of these rules for a named scope ("keep Phase 1.1 local — don't push it"; "keep the v1 reader for one week so I can re-render"), record it verbatim in the phase's END block. Restrictions and waivers are one-shot; the next phase reverts to the default. A restriction narrows delivery only — it never relaxes a gate and never closes a parked criterion.

# Project Context

## This Repo is Vellric

Independent local Python command-line PDF inspection, fidelity conversion, rendering and OCR. The canonical spelling is Vellric, package/CLI `vellric`. Read [the seed brief](briefs/BRIEF.md).

## Project briefs

- [Vellric seed brief and durable CLI design](briefs/BRIEF.md)

## Project surfaces

`project/`: isolated Python CLI scaffold, runtime, manifest/lock and tests. PDF behavior follows the reviewed seed brief; local implementation is authorized. Inherited tooling lives at the root. The public 0.1.0 surface includes standalone complete jobs and Drawbridge process integration. Release and consumer operations require their own current owner authorization.

## Project conventions

Python 3.12; `uv`, `project/pyproject.toml`, `project/uv.lock` and managed `project/.python-version` own the environment. Use `./bin/setup`, `./bin/test [args...]`, `./bin/check all`, `./bin/python`; authoritative overrides fail closed. Project grant: AGPL-3.0-only, selected by the owner on 2026-10-01. Distribution remains separately authorized. Retained Starter material keeps its MIT provenance and notices under `LICENSES/`.

The operator authorized local Vellric implementation on 2026-09-30 and said phase work is unnecessary for extraction/conversion unless strongly beneficial. Use the compact checklist in `plan/INDEX.md`; implement inline and obtain independent product review. Preserve methodology, skills and mirrors for later use.

## Model & review venue

`kickoff.yaml` holds human-editable routing, model/effort, timeout and research settings. `roles` is the optional validated editor. Keep Starter's universal routing and recipient restrictions; there is no transfer of credentials or account usage. Product advice may use an independently permitted instance; stamping/methodology adaptation stays primary one-shot.

`.claude/` is canonical. `.agents/skills/<name>` → `../../.claude/skills/<name>` exposes all resources. `.codex/agents/<role>.toml` is a thin canonical pointer with matching description. Edit canonical sources. Product phases use `kickoff`; methodology follows the routing rule below.

## Phase work and the `kickoff` skill

Invoke `/kickoff` (Claude Code) or `$kickoff` (Codex). Read the [kickoff](.claude/skills/kickoff/SKILL.md) and each linked resource before its branch, including follow-ups/recovery; links do not prove reads. Limits: root 20480 UTF-8 bytes; entry 10240. Preserve obligations and catalogs; move explanation to its owner.

### Status markers

Only [plan/INDEX.md](plan/INDEX.md) holds status: ⏳ not started, ⬅️ next, 🚧 in progress, ✅ completed. One marker per row; idle incomplete work has one arrow, active/complete work may have none; never multiple arrows. Explicitly select active work to resume. `kickoff` owns transitions; no per-phase `status`.

### Reading protocol for phase work

1. Read `plan/INDEX.md` for dependencies and cross-cutting concerns.
2. Read the parent phase if targeting a child, then the target phase.
3. Read every Brief ref and every pinned document on which it depends.
4. Read every `depends_on` file and the immediately preceding completed phase.
5. Read applicable policies, root invariants and the stage resource. Read only required phase files.

### Architectural invariants (load-bearing — do not violate)

Rationale: [methodology](briefs/methodology.md#operating-invariants-and-vocabulary).

- **Rules, not memory; Rule One.** Keep durable cross-harness knowledge in its owning repo authority. Diagnose failures, corrections, surprises and discarded work; separate containment, correction and prevention. File unsettled learning in `lessons/` and harvest every END/PARK, including `none`; only the human graduates rules.
- **Monotonic progress.** Hold authorized scope fixed; defer tangents once. Stop unsupported expansion. Dispatch authorized unblocked work or state the hold; inspect any command refusal before continuing.
- **Evidence over proxies.** Name the authoritative property, proxy, innocent triggers and sign-inversion risk. Read cited identifiers at their definitions; grep is a lead. Recheck affected callers, fixtures, tests and independent inventories.
- **Concrete uses; one home.** No speculative abstraction without a second present use. Consolidate at three copies; prefer fewer concepts. Use scripts for deterministic work and intelligence for contextual judgment.
- **Authority direction.** Policies prevail; plans refine and outrank briefs. Fix ambiguity at its owner; briefs never cite policies or plans.
- **Coherent outcomes.** Multiple surfaces and absent children do not require splitting. Split only at consequential decisions, independently accepted prerequisites, deployment/migration/human seams or demonstrated coherence limits. Ordinary internals belong to the coder; consequential scope stays approved. Never merge completed phases.
- **Empirical acceptance and product review.** Name falsifying checks and manual criteria. Discover broadly, batch evidenced blockers, separate optional advice, preserve stable findings; rebase on changed authority, scope, risk or lost continuity. Product primary mode uses advisory reports and at most two passes per stage for recorded cause; delegated mode preserves the role policy’s 600-line/growth/stall/ten-cycle limits. Methodology work requires no independent review.
- **Candidate-bound assurance.** Product identity binds review; full-tree identity binds gate non-mutation and delivery. Declared-authority and reviewed-bookkeeping checks remain independent. Unknown tracked classifications refuse; unknown nonignored untracked paths and `candidate-partition.yaml` itself stay active.
- **Targeted candidate, one full run.** Focused iteration precedes product critique; methodology work is self-checked by the primary. The implementation-candidate sequence ends in the changed-path selection `./bin/test --changed-from '@{upstream}'`; accepted close precedes captured status mutation. After all bookkeeping, the one bare `./bin/check all` handoff gate qualifies the push; no tracked write follows success. Bind prospective child completion; parent completion requires separate acceptance.
- **Execution truth.** One append-only trace, exact joins and overlap-safe unions; separately report operator-input parks. Missing measurement is unknown, never zero. Give a refusing command its own block and read its diagnostic before the next command; repair and delivery are where chaining recurs. Finalize evidence before sanitized offline reports.
- **Safe acceleration.** Use substantial, obvious low-risk time savings within scope, preserving correctness, coverage, determinism, the selected product review contract and both gates. No optimization tangents.
- **Atomic toolchain.** Runtime, metadata, lockfile, setup, focused/full tests, receipts, proofs and callers move together. Use repository wrappers; bad overrides and failed probes never fall back. Keep scratch captures outside the reviewable tree or explicitly ignored.
- **Methodology routing.** All authorized methodology work, including `teach` and `learn`, is one-shot by the primary with commit and fast-forward-push authority after required checks. No delegated planning/coding or independent review/critique. Applies across harnesses and model tiers. Read [review lanes](policies/review-lanes.md).
- **Portable parity.** Canonical sources and thin mirrors; repo-relative committed paths; isolated deliverable. Greenfield replacement and delivery/human-judgment boundaries follow the hard rules.

### Activity log (`LOG.md`)

Owning writers append via the deterministic writer at true EOF; preserve bytes and chronology. Parks stay `🚧`; terminal records carry Lessons, evidence, remaining work and truthful outcomes.

### User actions (`user-actions/`)

Glob `user-actions/*.md` at session start; read frontmatter and surface dependencies before work. File human-only actions before ending; use `bin/new-name`, record dependencies/deferral and archive closed entries. Agents close only personally completed actions; GUI, console, pricing and billing checkoff stays human-only.

### Lessons (`lessons/`)

Read both lesson directories before filing/recurring; one row per observation. Run `./bin/lessons validate` and `./bin/lessons candidates`. Human ratification owns graduation/rejection. Harvest process observations and failure analysis at each close/park.

## Universal conventions

Never hard-wrap Markdown prose: one physical line per paragraph, including list-item prose. Preserve syntax-required breaks. Give one executable command per copyable shell fence. Use bare skill names in neutral prose and both harness invocation forms when showing commands. Follow `plain` for operator messages; peers retain full technical fidelity. Use User/operator/owner and they/them in durable role language; authorship credit is separate.

Agent decisions use kickoff’s input-park/`blocked-owner` route; unattended decisions park in artifacts. Only the operator invokes `ask`. Record rulings at their authority and human work in `user-actions/`.
