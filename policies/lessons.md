# Policy: Lessons

The [`lessons/`](../lessons/) directory at the repo root is the **ledger of candidate process lessons** — durable learnings harvested from phase work, reviews, dispositions, and transfers that have not yet been ratified into a rule. Every agentic project ships with this directory from the first session.

A **lesson** is one such learning: a specific, generalizable observation about how work in this repo (or the methodology itself) should be done differently next time. The ledger is the capture stage of the repo's improvement flywheel. It exists so that learnings accumulate as discrete, addressable, provenance-carrying entries instead of evaporating at session end or being smeared into instruction files by ad-hoc rewrites. Rewriting rule documents wholesale from memory degrades them (brevity bias, context collapse); itemized capture with human-ratified graduation is the discipline that avoids both.

This policy prescribes the directory's layout, the per-file format, scope classification, the graduation rule, and who may write what. The policy *is* the format spec — there is no separate template.

## One file per lesson

Each lesson is its own markdown file:

- **Open lessons** live in `lessons/<slug>.md` with `status: candidate`.
- **Closed lessons** live in `lessons-archived/<slug>.md` with `status: codified | rejected | superseded`.

The **filename is the slug** (a two-word code-name): `sandbox-phantom.md`. There is intentionally **no index file** — same contention rationale as [`user-actions.md`](user-actions.md): one-file-per-lesson lets concurrent agents append to the ledger without editing a shared list. Each file is fully self-contained.

## What `lessons/` is

- The repo's structured memory of "what we keep re-learning," parallel to `LOG.md` (history) and `user-actions/` (human-only follow-ups).
- The input queue for rule-making: a lesson that recurs graduates — with the human's explicit approval — into a policy, brief, skill, agent definition, `bin/` script, test, or `CLAUDE.md` invariant.
- In a derived project, the `scope: methodology` subset is the standing export surface the starter harvests via the `learn` skill.

## What `lessons/` is not

- Not a bug tracker or work backlog. Work an agent can do goes in `plan/`; human-only actions go in `user-actions/`.
- Not a rule surface. A candidate lesson binds nothing; only graduation makes it binding, and only the human graduates.
- Not agent-side memory. Per [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)'s "Rules, not memory" invariant, the ledger is a committed repo surface visible to every operator and harness — never a local memory store.

## Format

### Frontmatter (all metadata)

```yaml
---
slug: sandbox-phantom          # matches the filename
title: Distrust in-sandbox test failures without a host-side rerun
status: candidate              # candidate  (open)  ·  codified | rejected | superseded  (archived)
scope: methodology             # local | methodology
proposed_surface: policy       # policy | brief | skill | agent | bin | test | invariant
filed: 2026-08-10              # ISO date first filed
source: kickoff                # kickoff | sweep | disposition | learn | teach | user
occurrences:                   # every observation of this lesson, in order
  - date: 2026-08-10
    ref: "Phase 10.3 END"      # a phase id, LOG entry, verdict, or disposition slug
---
```

Archived files additionally carry:

```yaml
status: codified               # codified | rejected | superseded
closed: 2026-08-21             # ISO date closed
graduated_to: policies/role-timeouts.md   # required when codified — the surface the rule landed on
```

- `scope: local` — the lesson binds only this project (a convention, a quirk of this codebase or its tooling).
- `scope: methodology` — the lesson's remedy would change the methodology itself: how agents plan, review, implement, verify, gate, deliver, record evidence, route roles, keep this ledger, or transfer the methodology — a change to the template's policies, skills, agents, briefs, or tooling. It is an upstream candidate for the starter template.

**The scope test is the remedy, not the insight.** A lesson that is sound general engineering, testing, performance, or domain practice — true of any codebase — is `local`, however well it generalizes, because it would change none of the methodology's surfaces. The starter's ledger holds only `methodology` lessons: `learn` ingests no other kind, and a lesson that fails the test is closed as `rejected` (not methodology-specific) rather than kept open. (Operator ruling, 2026-09-29, after 25 of 61 open lessons failed this test.)
- `proposed_surface` names where the rule would land if ratified; the graduating human may override it.

No other new frontmatter keys without amending this policy.

### One row per instance — the counting rule

**An occurrence row is one observation, not one filing session.** Several
instances of the same shape seen on the same day, in the same phase, or sharing
one root cause each get their own row. Batching them into a single row with a
compound `ref` under-counts the lesson.

This is not bookkeeping pedantry: the three-occurrence graduation threshold is
evaluated by `bin/lessons candidates` over **row count**, so a batched filing
silently suppresses the trigger. A donor project's sweep turned up three
lessons in this state — one documenting three distinct instances in a single
row, and therefore sitting at the threshold invisibly since the day it was
filed. A rule whose trigger can be defeated by formatting is a rule wired to
nothing.

**There is deliberately no automated check for this, and the failed attempt is
worth recording so nobody rebuilds it.** Three lexical detectors were written
against the donor's ledger and all three were cut. Matching `, then ` and
lists of three fired on 17 of 46 lessons and was right about 3 — ordinary
narrative trips both ("recurred four times, then parked the phase" is one
observation). Matching "N times in …" fired 4 times and was right once,
because that phrase usually counts how often some *tool* misbehaved during a
single incident. The survivor — matching only a row that says outright it
covers two — fired once across the whole ledger and was blind to the shape
that caused the problem: a row that merely narrates its instances without
counting them.

The property "this sentence describes more than one observation" is not
reliably visible in the sentence. A near-silent guard is worse than none,
because a clean `LESSONS OK` then reads as coverage the check never had. So
the enforcement is the rule above, applied when filing, and **`sweep`'s
lessons audit, which reads each `ref` against its own body** — the only thing
that has ever actually caught this.

### Body

Below the frontmatter, one to a few paragraphs stating the lesson: what happened, why, and what should be done differently. Concrete beats abstract — "run X before Y because Z bit us in Phase N," not "be careful with X." An optional `## Evidence` section may cite transcripts, logs, or diffs.

## Slug discipline

Same recipe and rules as [`user-actions.md`](user-actions.md): a stable two-word slug, unique across both `lessons/` and `lessons-archived/`, never reused after closure.

```bash
./bin/new-name
```

The generator filters connective filler tokens and checks the candidate against all four ledger directories (`lessons*/`, `user-actions*/`) before printing it.

## Lifecycle

1. **File or recur.** When a harvest (see "Who writes" below) surfaces a candidate lesson, first check both directories for an existing entry stating the same lesson. If one exists, **append an occurrence** to it rather than filing a duplicate; if it is archived as `rejected`, appending a new occurrence with fresh evidence is how the case for reconsideration is made. Otherwise file a new `lessons/<slug>.md` with `status: candidate` and one occurrence.
2. **Stabilize.** A lesson graduates on the strength of recurrence, not eloquence. The working threshold is **three occurrences** — codifying on first sight tends to lock in rules that haven't seen their variations. The human may graduate a lesson earlier at their discretion; agents may not.
3. **Graduate (human-only).** Graduation is a user-ratified edit to the target surface plus archival of the lesson: set `status: codified`, add `closed:` and `graduated_to:`, and move the file to `lessons-archived/`. Agents *propose* graduation — as `DECIDE`-style items in a phase's END block or a `sweep` plan — and never apply it. A rejected proposal is archived `status: rejected`; a lesson absorbed by another is `status: superseded`.

4. **Age out.** A candidate whose newest occurrence is sixty days old is proposed at the next sweep for closing as `rejected` (not recurring), in one batched decision the human can pull items out of. `./bin/lessons aged` lists them. A new occurrence resets the clock, and an aged-out lesson reopens the usual way: a new occurrence with fresh evidence appended to the archived entry. A lesson the human held is aged like any other; the hold records why it did not graduate, not a reason to keep it open.

Archived files **stay on disk** — they are the audit trail linking every rule back to the incidents that earned it, and the record of what was considered and declined.

### The second-instance test — state the rule, not the example

A rule graduated from an incident **must name one other instance it also catches**, and that instance must differ from the originating one in tool, surface, or subject matter. If no second instance can be named, the text is stated at its example rather than at its class, and it does not graduate in that form.

The test exists because a rule written at its example is true, reads as sufficient, and does not fire. The evidence is a donor project's eight sightings of one species — a check, count, control, proof, or report that succeeded while proving less than its name claimed — where each narrow rule failed to catch the next member. One of those rules ("never truncate the field you reason from") was written mid-phase and violated hours later, on different output, by the reader who had cited it that same day. The rule was correct. It named a command instead of a class, so nobody recognised the next instance as the same thing.

Applying the test is cheap and its failures are informative:

- **Two instances that differ in tool, surface, or subject while sharing one diagnosis** mean the rule is already at its class; state it there and cite both.
- **A second instance that requires stretching** means the class is not yet identified. File the occurrence and wait rather than graduating the stretch.
- **No second instance** means one observation. Per the threshold above, that is a candidate, not a rule.

This test is the reason a family's covering sentence usually cannot graduate while its members can: the covering sentence catches every member by construction, so the second-instance test is trivially satisfied and tells you nothing, which is the same abstraction failure § Named families forbids. Graduate members on their own evidence; graduate a family-level rule only when it is checkable against work in hand, not merely descriptive of work already done.

## Named families

A family is a set of open lessons whose **diagnoses rhyme**. Naming one does not
merge its members and does not change any occurrence count: each lesson keeps
its own slug, evidence, and remedy. The name exists so the next lesson of that
shape can be filed **against** the family rather than beside it, and so a body
of evidence stops reading as a pile of unrelated one-offs.

**Do not collapse a family into a single entry.** A rule general enough to
cover every member is too abstract to fire — the failure the counting rule
above exists to prevent, in another costume. Merge two lessons only when their
**remedies** coincide, not when their diagnoses do — that is a `superseded`
archival with the occurrences carried onto the survivor, and it needs the same
human ratification as any graduation.

Membership is a judgment recorded in the sweep or the policy that names the
family, not a frontmatter key — a lesson can sit in a family and still graduate
on its own evidence. (Two families the donor named, offered here as worked
examples of the shape: *the fix covers the named instance, not the class*, and
*the instrument reports positive and proves nothing*.)

### Who writes

- **Any agent** may file a candidate lesson or append an occurrence: `kickoff`'s harvest step at every truthful phase close or park, `sweep` during a maintenance pass, a `user-actions` disposition, `learn`/`teach` during a transfer, or the user directly. A parked run is evidence, not a reason to discard its observations.
- **`learn` keeps two inputs distinct.** Donor-ledger lessons are harvested as
  direct rule proposals or destination-ledger candidates. New methodology
  defects exposed while adapting the approved bundle are filed separately in
  the destination ledger with `source: learn` and `scope: methodology`; the
  donor remains read-only. The aggregate LOG entry reports both counts.
- **Only the human** graduates, and only the human edits `policies/`, `briefs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, skills, or agent definitions *because of* a lesson. Filing and occurrence-appending are the only ledger writes an agent performs autonomously.

## Anonymization on the upstream path

A `scope: methodology` lesson in a derived repo is destined for the starter template, which is public. When such a lesson is harvested into the starter (via `learn` or by hand), it obeys the starter's own `anonymize-log-references.md` policy *before being written*: no external project names, commit SHAs, or proprietary identifiers. The starter's `bin/check-anonymization.sh` scans the whole tree, so `lessons/` and `lessons-archived/` are inside its net. Write the lesson so the learning survives that translation — state the mechanism and the failure mode, not just the local names, so a reader with no context from the originating project can still act on it.

## Relationship to other artifacts

- A lesson that must bind **now** isn't a lesson — it's a rule; take it straight to the human as a proposed policy/brief edit.
- A human-only follow-up goes in `user-actions/`; if its disposition reveals a recurring learning, the disposition files a lesson here (see [`user-actions.md`](user-actions.md)).
- Ripple (per [`phase-ripple.md`](phase-ripple.md)) propagates *content* into downstream plan files; lessons capture *process* learnings. The same phase close runs both, and neither substitutes for the other.

## Verification

```bash
./bin/lessons validate
```

```bash
./bin/lessons list --status candidate
```

```bash
./bin/lessons candidates
```

`validate` enforces this policy's schema mechanically (closed key set, enums, slug uniqueness across both directories, well-formed occurrences); `candidates` lists graduation-ready lessons (≥3 occurrences, still `candidate`). The judgment calls — is this lesson true, has it stabilized, which surface — remain human, per [`mechanistic-vs-intelligence.md`](mechanistic-vs-intelligence.md).

## Per-phase waiver

The human may grant a phase-specific waiver of any rule in this policy (for example, authorizing immediate codification of a first-occurrence lesson). Waivers are explicit, scoped, logged in the phase's END block, and one-shot — same contract as [`user-actions.md`](user-actions.md).
