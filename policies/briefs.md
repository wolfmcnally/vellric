# Briefs — Policy

This file defines what `briefs/` is in this project, who writes there, and how briefs relate to `policies/`.

## What briefs are

`briefs/` is a **read-write working library** of internal documents — research, methodology, audits, source-material snapshots, positions taken, options weighed — produced and consulted as the project evolves. It holds *thinking*, not settled decisions: what a brief works out may or may not become a rule, and the rules themselves live in `policies/` ([`briefs-and-policies.md`](briefs-and-policies.md)). Much of a brief is never pinned down, which is normal rather than a defect.

A brief captures *durable* analysis or reasoning that future work will refer back to. A brief is the answer to questions like:
- "What's the canonical way to do X, and where did we get that?"
- "Why did we decide Y? What did we evaluate?"
- "What was the state of the world when we last checked Z?"
- "Did we already research this?"

## What briefs are not

- **Code.** Anything executable lives in `bin/` or the eventual application tree.
- **A queue.** Work to be done lives in commit messages, a TODO list, or an issue tracker — not in `briefs/`.
- **A policy.** Operational rules — "always do X, never Y, here's the schema" — live in `policies/`. A brief *informs* policy; a brief is not policy.
- **A log.** Briefs capture durable positions, not running history.
- **Third-party documentation.** Vendor pages, specifications, RFCs, and license texts are pinned verbatim under `docs/` ([`docs.md`](docs.md)). A brief cites the pin and holds what the project *concluded* from it; it never carries the source text itself.

## When to write one

Write a brief when:
- Research turns up a position or methodology the team will cite later (a BCP list, a measured number, a worked example).
- A non-trivial decision is made whose reasoning matters more than its outcome.
- An audit, evaluation, or discrepancy review produces findings that will inform future work.
- A snapshot of an external system's *observed state or behavior* (cloud infrastructure as configured, how a third-party service actually responded) is worth pinning at a specific date. The vendor's own published document is a different thing: that goes under `docs/`, and the brief records what was observed and concluded against it.
- An outward explanation, white paper, or treatise needs a canonical internal
  source. Repair the owning brief before rendering derivative formats; see
  [`treatise.md`](treatise.md).

Don't write a brief for ephemeral state, single-session decisions, or anything that fits inside a commit message.

## Conventions

- **Filename:** kebab-case, descriptive (`s3-access-log-bcps.md`, not `notes-04.md`). No dates in filenames.
- **Frontmatter (YAML):** every brief opens with:
  - `title:` — short scannable title.
  - `date:` — ISO date authored or last revised.
  - `status:` — one of `draft` | `methodology` | `implemented` | `historical`.
  - `scope:` — one sentence describing the brief's purpose.
  - `treatise:` — **only on a treatise brief.** A mapping holding that
    treatise's editorial record: purpose, audience, register, coverage, the
    operator's dated directives, renderings, and external facts. Its presence is
    what marks the brief as governed by [`treatise.md`](treatise.md), and
    `bin/treatise validate` enforces its shape. Ordinary briefs never carry it.
- **Body:** purpose paragraph, then numbered or named sections, then a Sources section if applicable.
- **Cross-references:** when one brief depends on another's numbers or methodology, link explicitly so the dependency is auditable.

## Status lifecycle

- `draft` — still being shaped; numbers and conclusions tentative.
- `methodology` — defines an approach the project defers to. This is a *lifecycle* value like the other three, and **not** a portability marker: a brief earns it by stating an approach the project defers to, whether or not that brief travels to another repo, and a methodology brief later realized in code correctly moves on to `implemented`. **Portability is decided by the `CLAUDE.md` catalog, not by `status`** — the Project briefs / Methodology briefs split there is what `stamp` copies from and what a cross-repo `learn` or `teach` pass reads. Do not infer either fact from the other.
- `implemented` — the position has been realized in code or operational practice.
- `historical` — superseded by a later brief or by changed reality; kept for the audit trail.

When reality changes, prefer updating the brief to retiring it; mark superseded briefs `historical` rather than deleting them.

## Authority

Briefs are subordinate to active `policies/` for next-action questions. They are *authoritative* for cross-session reasoning, methodology, and snapshot-of-the-world claims.

When a brief and a more current source disagree, prefer the live source — but update or annotate the brief to reflect the new reality. Briefs decay if not maintained.
