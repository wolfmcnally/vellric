# Policy: Candidate-Bound Orchestration Evidence

## Primary evidence operations

Run metadata freezes the workflow from the verified preflight receipt. `required_initial_roles` derives only the independent stages in primary mode; inline planning/coding uses orchestration stages and creates no child attempts. `register-role-attempt --cause <text>` captures the primary's reason for a second review. `watch` invokes `start-advice` before launch; the phase-bound budget persists across run directories. No third pass or cause-free second pass is permitted.

`ingest-findings` selects the advisory schema in primary mode and stores immutable observations in `advisory-reports.json`, joined to the actual read-only dispatch. `accept-primary --input <json>` accepts delta_assessment, requirements_checked and dispositions; each disposition has finding (`report_id:id`), action (adopt/decline/defer), reason and verification. The tool captures the current candidate and report digest. Material findings need rationale; adopted findings need verification. Optional low/informational suggestions need no individual ledger row. Acceptance validation requires all necessary independent reports and a current primary decision, not adviser approval or zero suggestions. The normal gate and custody checks still run.

A correction after advice changes the accepted candidate. The primary records its delta assessment and runs fresh tests without relabeling the older report as review of the new bytes. Direct methodology work uses the scope/log route and an explicit independent-review-not-applicable disposition, never synthetic kickoff reports.

Authority mode follows [four-canonical-agents.md](four-canonical-agents.md). Product primary mode uses independent advice and primary acceptance; delegated product mode retains approval verdicts and bounded revision loops. References below to reviewer assent or mandatory re-review govern delegated work only. Required objective gates and truthful evidence apply in both modes. All methodology work, including teach/learn, follows [review-lanes.md](review-lanes.md): one-shot by the primary, no delegated production or review, and commit/fast-forward-push authority after required checks.

`kickoff` preserves independent review while making later rounds incremental.
Every material review, revision, and gate is bound to exact run-scoped
evidence. Narrative continuity or a remembered green result is not evidence.

## Run isolation

After the target phase or sub-phase is resolved and before its first
implementation role invocation, allocate a new opaque run directory with
`mktemp -d`; never reuse a predictable path from an earlier or interrupted
run. A just-in-time decomposition call belongs to the parent-resolution
pre-run and does not share evidence with the child run it creates. Evidence is
local runtime state and stays under a gitignored location or the run-scoped
temporary directory. It is not committed.

Initialize the run through `./bin/python bin/kickoff-evidence init` with the phase file,
its cited briefs, applicable policies, `plan/INDEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, declared
dependencies, the immediately preceding completed phase as authorities, and the
fresh `bin/kickoff-config preflight --receipt` artifact for the resolved role
topology. A missing, stale, malformed, or differently configured receipt refuses
initialization and final validation.

Never declare a contract file the approved plan will change — a policy, brief, document or fixture in the phase's own write set. The manifest hashes whole files, so such a declaration guarantees an authority-drift refusal at acceptance; place the acceptance seam after the planned edits instead. This is not a licence to work outside declared authority: a file the phase must edit *and* reason from is a scope question for the operator, not a silent omission. `plan/INDEX.md` remains declared — its start flip precedes capture and its close transition is bound separately by the accepted close.

Original files remain authoritative; the manifest is an index and drift
sensor, not a summary that replaces them.

`init` requires both lane declarations (`--review-lane full|light|one-shot`,
`--evidence-lane full|light` — [`review-lanes.md`](review-lanes.md)) and
derives the run's required role operations and orchestration stages from them:
`one-shot` drops the planner attempt and the planning stage mechanically. Both
lanes are recorded immutably in the run metadata. In the `light` evidence
lane, role registration, span joins, and stage envelopes are validated when
present but their absence does not fail validation — the recorded lane is the
auditable declaration of that demotion. Everything else in this policy is
lane-independent, and the final candidate-bound gate under
`validate --level acceptance` is mandatory in every lane.

## Candidate identity

`./bin/python bin/kickoff-tree-id` hashes the complete tracked and nonignored-untracked tree, including deletions, normalized modes and symlink targets. Staging identical bytes does not change identity; dirty submodules and escaping symlinks refuse. The `--product` form excludes only paths classified bookkeeping by the repository-root `candidate-partition.yaml`.

The declaration is the sole classification authority. It is itself active and product manifests carry its exact `partition_sha256`. Changing the declaration moves the product identity. The supported YAML subset has `schema: agentic.candidate-partition.v1`, `active:` and `bookkeeping:` block lists of JSON-quoted strings, blank lines, and full-line comments. Patterns are root-anchored; `*` and `?` stay within a path segment, and whole-segment `**` spans segments. Bookkeeping takes precedence regardless of order. Bare root catch-alls, duplicate fields or patterns, unsupported syntax, and self-exclusion refuse.

Every tracked path must classify. Nonignored untracked paths with no classification remain included as active with an explicit diagnostic; staging them requires classification. `bin/check-candidate-partition` enforces the declaration in the policy gate, and `--staged` reads the complete index and the indexed declaration in the opt-in commit hook. The initial bookkeeping scope preserves root logs, `plan/INDEX.md`, and lesson/user-action ledgers. Briefs, phase definitions, policies, harness instructions, configuration, tests, and code remain active. Each stamped recipient defines its own explicit active inventory; donor classifications never transfer as judgments.

Reviews, dispatch pairs, finding introduction/resolution, revision packets, and gate requests bind the product candidate. Gate artifacts retain full-tree before/after identities as well as product identities; full-tree mutation during a gate fails. Handoff, commit custody, and push receipts cover the complete tree and the selected runtime. Neither full phase-close gate is omitted.

`current-candidate` recomputes and records product identity in the run's lineage. A new finding's `introduced_in` may name any observed lineage candidate. `resolved_in` must name the current product candidate, with no drift exception. An unobserved id, active change, or stale resolution stamp refuses. Bookkeeping-only changes need no special acceptance record.

Path classification is a proxy for relevance, not a claim that a file can never matter. Declared-authority checks remain independent. Full snapshots also protect bookkeeping explicitly named in changed files, findings, or declared authorities: a later change refuses until it is captured and reviewed again. A bookkeeping match never grants general repair or write authority.

## Evidence records

`./bin/python bin/kickoff-evidence` owns and validates four records:

- **Authority manifest:** repository-relative path, content hash, optional
  locator, and priority.
- **Change manifest:** reviewed/current candidate ids; added, modified,
  mode-changed, and deleted paths; risk tags; selected tests and selection
  reason; falsifiers (the mutation that reds each new test); the coder's
  focused gate status; intentionally unchanged neighbors; authority drift; review-rebase
  reasons.
- **Finding ledger:** stable id, severity, authority, evidence, affected
  paths, required outcome, introduction/resolution candidates, state,
  classification, and disposition.
- **Gate ledger:** structured argv, full-tree and product candidate ids, active command-manifest digest, selection reason, exit status, final-gate flag, and optional artifact digest. Managed executions start with an unknown warning count. After complete diagnostics are inspected, `review-gate` appends the observed count and assessment to `gate-reviews.jsonl`, bound to the exact immutable gate-record hash. Acceptance refuses unreviewed managed executions, invalid review bindings and unexplained review replacement. Corrections name the preceding review hash through `--supersedes`; they never create another execution or alter measured gate counts. Imported nonfinal evidence records an already observed count through `record-gate`.

A full-evidence run activates one immutable content-addressed command manifest
before managed gates begin. Activation is append-only; a successor must name
the digest it supersedes. `run-gate` admits only an argv that exactly matches an
active `(operation, attempt, final)` row, and final validation refuses a final
gate bound to an older manifest. Display quoting is never execution authority.

Exact fields are the executable schema in `./bin/python bin/kickoff-evidence`; behavioral
tests are the contract floor. Agents exercise judgment to produce the facts.
The script validates and projects them mechanically.

## Findings and convergence

Plan findings use `PLAN-FNNN`; code findings use `CODE-FNNN`. An id continues
to mean the same authority and required outcome for its lifetime.

Allowed states are `open`, `addressed`, `verified`, `closed`,
`rejected-with-evidence`, `blocked-owner`, and `superseded`. Closure requires
the candidate that resolved the finding. Reopening a verified, closed, or
rejected finding is explicit and counted.

`addressed → rejected-with-evidence` is legal: it is the reviewer accepting an
implementer's counter-argument, which is a different outcome from the reviewer
rejecting a finding on first look. Without that edge a finding answered by
evidence rather than by a change had no truthful terminal state and had to be
walked backwards through `open` to reach one.

The first review batches every blocker found. Revision review resolves the
existing ledger first, then examines the causal change surface. A new finding
is classified `introduced-by-revision`, `newly-exposed-by-resolution`, or
`missed-in-full-pass`; an initial finding is classified `initial`.

Continue a loop only while at least one blocking finding advances and no
closed finding reopens at equal or greater severity. Escalate on recurrence,
oscillation, authority disagreement, or two consecutive rounds that reduce
neither open severity nor uncertainty. The ten-cycle cap remains a hard
runaway backstop; below it, continuation is the supervising authority's
judgment call
([`four-canonical-agents.md § Runaway backstop`](four-canonical-agents.md)).

## Revision packets and rebasing

`./bin/python bin/kickoff-evidence packet` compiles the revision packet. It includes
unresolved findings, reviewed/current candidate ids, causal path/hash changes,
authority drift, risk/test-selection facts, the coder's failure analysis, gate
evidence, and explicit omission rules. Closed, rejected, superseded,
unchanged-authority, and unchanged-candidate details may be omitted because
their source hashes remain recorded and original files remain readable.

The failure analysis is the reflexion contract: on every revision round the
coder's Change Evidence must state *why* the previous attempt produced the
findings being fixed — root cause, not restatement — and `capture-change`
rejects a revision capture that omits it. The packet carries the analysis
forward so the next review judges the fix against the coder's own theory of
the failure, and the phase-close lessons harvest ([`lessons.md`](lessons.md))
reads it as sensor input.

Rebase to a complete review when authority or scope changes, a new risk class
appears, a public API or persisted format changes, security/concurrency/
irreversible-state boundaries change, the revision disperses beyond the
reviewed surface, an acceptance claim is invalidated outside the prior delta,
or trustworthy continuity is lost. When impact is indeterminate, rebase.

## Candidate-bound verification

Use four levels:

1. focused, smallest falsifying behavioral test or proof during editing;
2. affected suites and static/structural checks at revision close;
3. the phase-prescribed sequence ending in the changed-path selection
   `./bin/test --changed-from '@{upstream}'` after code-critic approval, against the unchanged
   approved implementation candidate (it widens itself to the full suite when
   the change cannot be mapped safely);
4. a bare `./bin/check all` after every tracked close write, against the actual
   handoff tree; it is the phase's one full run and its receipt qualifies the
   push.

Before an expensive acceptance sequence, run `bin/kickoff-command-zero`. It
validates the manifest, venue receipt, and stage topology; dry-runs every
declared selector; checks format; and proves both the exact committed-log prefix
and effective log chronology, stopping at the first refusal. Cheap structural
failure must not spend the full-gate budget.

**Probe consumers before an expensive or irreversible acceptance step.** When a
phase's acceptance includes a long or externally-irreversible run — a live data
migration, a deploy, a bulk external operation — every identity the change
touched is first resolved through its **production consumer**, as recorded
**non-final** rows, before that run begins: a data repair that satisfies
file-and-ledger inspection can still fail the first thing that consumes it, and
neither a coder forbidden from the live run nor a read-only critic can see that.
No full-suite rehearsal precedes the irreversible run; the phase's one full run
is the handoff gate (operator ruling, 2026-09-29).

The implementation-candidate contract is unchanged: its final gate, the
changed-path selection, runs last against the unchanged approved candidate, and
consumer-probe rows are explicitly non-final. After close bookkeeping changes
the tree, the separate handoff gate proves that actual tree.

Record every candidate-bound implementation gate and its selection reason.
When the repository exposes governed `vital` or `changed` lanes, use their
deterministic selection for iteration and the implementation gate only after proof-estate validation has
established the retained estate and retain the manager's family/reason record;
legitimate overlapping mappings select their union. Explicit
agent-judged selectors remain valid for a named falsifier. Invalid governance,
unmapped impact, or unsupported execution widens to full. No lane replaces
level 4 above, and full means the complete retained estate after
the required local reset rather than a small lane over an untouched shadow
suite. A relevant candidate change
invalidates prior gate evidence. Verify candidate identity before and after
the implementation sequence; mutation by a read-only gate fails the phase.
`./bin/python bin/kickoff-evidence validate --level acceptance --required-final-command
"./bin/test --changed-from '@{upstream}'"` is the mechanical implementation acceptance proof and must
run immediately after the implementation gate, before status and append-only
log bookkeeping change the working tree. It also refuses close bookkeeping
while a finding remains `open`,
`addressed`, or `blocked-owner`. Close-out bookkeeping may follow; it does not
retroactively change the accepted implementation candidate, but the bare
handoff gate must pass before completion is reported. Its ignored full-gate
receipt binds the post-bookkeeping tree. No tracked write may follow a
successful handoff gate.

The ordinary commit and non-force push of gate-proved work
([`human-in-the-loop.md`](human-in-the-loop.md)) are close-out bookkeeping in
exactly that sense: they run only after successful acceptance validation
validation and the handoff gate, they change no tracked content, and they
therefore leave the accepted candidate identity intact. An operator restriction
may suppress either action; neither may be used to repair a failed gate.

## The registration file is not the ledger

`register-role-attempt` does two writes: it appends the record to the run's
append-only `role-attempts.jsonl`, and it writes that same record, alone, to the
path given as `--output`. **`--output` is the registration file** — the one a
dispatch passes as `--telemetry-role-registration`, and the one the watcher
cross-checks for uniqueness against the ledger. The ledger itself is never a
registration: `bin/kickoff-config watch` refuses it by name. It has to, because a
ledger holding exactly one record is also a valid JSON object and would parse,
so the same argument would work for the first role registered and die on the
second — an order-dependent trap that teaches the wrong contract and fails at the
worst moment. Give each attempt its own `--output` path.

The watcher derives the trace, root span, operation and attempt from that authenticated registration. Callers supply only `--telemetry-role-registration` for telemetry routing. The registered trace root remains the role's parent, even while the orchestrator has a stage span open; a caller cannot replace it with the current stage. Role, model, venue and effort must still match the registration, with field-specific diagnostics on disagreement.

## Every registered attempt has an intelligence span, rejections included

An attempt the watcher refuses before launch still consumed a registration, so
validation still demands exactly one closed `intelligence` span for it. A
rejected dispatch opens that span and closes it **error 127 at rejection time**,
records `--idle-telemetry not-dispatched`, and creates **no** wait span.
`record-role-dispatch` refuses a dispatch that names no intelligence span, and
that refusal is deliberate: terminal amendments are append-only, so a
span-less terminal row makes the whole run unvalidatable and cannot be repaired
afterwards — creating the span late only moves the error to "dispatch and
intelligence span ids do not agree". Correctness is required at write time, not
forgiven at read time.

## Native span recipes and declared telemetry gaps

A delegated dispatch has its `intelligence` and `wait` spans built by
`bin/kickoff-config watch`. A native dispatch does not, and validation joins
both spans against the registration field by field — so an orchestrator that
hand-builds the pair and omits one `--model` produces a join that can never
close, because a span is immutable once finished. `register-role-attempt`
therefore writes `<handoff>.span-recipe.json` for every native attempt and
prints its path; `span-recipe` re-emits it, substituting the intelligence span
id into the wait argv. Do not hand-assemble either command.

When a wait-span join is nonetheless broken, the run may **own the defect in
writing** with `record-telemetry-incomplete`, naming the exact span, the exact
missing fields, and the cause. Validation then reports that attempt as
telemetry-incomplete — in `timing-summary`'s markdown section and its
`telemetry_incomplete` projection array — instead of refusing outright. The
declaration is not a bypass:

- a wait span that is **absent** still fails, because degradation covers a
  malformed span, never a missing one;
- the declaration must name the span the trace actually carries;
- every excused field must really be defective, and every defective field must
  really be excused — a record that excuses a correct field, or omits a broken
  one, fails;
- a declaration for an unregistered attempt fails.

The reasoning is that a validator which can only refuse converts one honest
orchestrator slip into a phase that can never close, which pressures the next
operator toward fabricating a passing record. A typed, bounded degradation
keeps the record honest and the contract satisfiable at once. Attempts closed
this way are measured, not omitted: their intelligence spans and durations stay
exact.

`repin-tools` re-pins a run's bundle to the current tree and prints both
manifest digests. It exists for the case the snapshot cannot serve — a repair
the active run itself needs — and is deliberately explicit rather than silent.

## An unmeasured review pass is caught while it can still be repaired

Acceptance validation refuses in the full evidence lane whenever an accepted review dispatch closed
successfully and its intelligence span carries no convergence integers. It
names each `operation#attempt` with its span id.

The check has to run there because the repair only exists there. Re-ingesting
the pass's findings with `--review-span-id` attaches the metrics to a live
span; once the trace finalizes the span is immutable and that route is gone.
Checking only at `timing-summary` meant a run passed validation all night with
unmeasured passes and discovered the gap after finalization, when the only
remaining "repair" would re-ingest earlier artifacts, drive `verified → open`,
and reopen resolved findings to satisfy a validator. The check runs on the
run's **runtime** spans, not a finalized bundle, precisely so it works on an
open trace.

Four of the five incidents recorded upstream were not uningestable batches at
all: the ingest was chained into a command block ending in a backgrounded
dispatch, so its refusal was never read. The batches were repairable at the
time and nothing looked. This latch is what looks.

## Derived convergence metrics for a refused batch

A review pass that genuinely succeeded and whose batch was then **structurally
refused** closes with a successful span and no metrics, and the latch above
cannot help once the trace is closed. `attach-derived-metrics` is the
sanctioned recovery. It is an **overlay** — the record lives in
`derived-metrics.jsonl` and `validate` reads it when the span has none — never
a span attach. Two reasons: a finalized span cannot be written at all, which is
exactly where the gap bites; and a derived number written onto a span whose
ingest never produced it would be indistinguishable from a measured one.

Every ingest, accepted or refused, appends one row to the run's append-only
`ingest-log.jsonl`, carrying the artifact digest, the reported finding count,
the namespace-restricted `{id: state}` ledger captured **before** any mutation,
and — on a refusal — the typed refusal codes. That recorded base is what makes
the merge replayable after `findings.json` has been rewritten wholesale. Only
refusals about the batch's own content are journaled; a bad run directory,
inconsistent flags, a candidate mismatch, or an unreadable artifact is an
orchestrator error, not a defect in a review pass. On the accepted path the row
is appended after the ledger is written, so the journal can never claim a merge
that did not land.

The derivation declares a **refusal class** — the machine-checkable fact of
which rule fired — from a closed set:

- `finding-id-format`
- `resolved-in-not-current-candidate`
- `immutable-field-restated`

It supplies no integers. There is no `--findings-reported` and no
`--actionable-findings`: operator-supplied numbers are what make a record an
assertion instead of a measurement. The tool computes both from the refused
artifact and the journal row's recorded base, and `validate` **recomputes and
compares** them on every run. That recomputation is the analogue of "every
excused field must really be defective" above; without it this would be a
write-only ledger with no reader that could ever contradict it.

One operator input does reach a recorded integer, and it is named here rather
than left implicit: **`--id-map`**, on the `finding-id-format` class alone. The
bijection must be total over the malformed ids, injective, in-namespace, and
free of collisions *within the batch* — but a target may legally land on an
existing ledger entry, because `open → open` is an allowed transition. Mapping
a malformed id onto an existing `open` finding therefore merges two actionable
entries and lowers `actionable_findings` by one, in the flattering direction.
This grants no power the ordinary ingest path lacks — a reviewer can emit that
same id directly — and `--corroborating-artifact` removes the discretion
entirely, because the identity check then pins every id to a batch that was
measured natively.

The record is not a bypass:

- the declared class must match a **recorded** refusal — of that exact artifact,
  named against that exact review span — with **exactly** that class's codes;
  extra codes refuse, because a batch that also carried a substance defect was
  never a measurable review pass, and an ingest that was never attempted proves
  nothing at all;
- the span must be the pass's own successful review intelligence span and must
  **not** already carry metrics; a pass whose ingest landed has nothing to
  derive;
- both integers must **recompute** from artifacts still present at their
  recorded digests, replaying the four rules the recorded base can answer —
  namespace prefix, `introduced_in` lineage, `resolved_in` currency, and the
  allowed state transitions — with only the declared class's own rule
  suppressed. The immutable-field check, the evidence-substitution check,
  the placeholder-evidence check (`carried forward unchanged` / `text not
  supplied` is not evidence), and the suspected-not-blocking check (a
  read-only reviewer's unexecuted claim, marked `SUSPECTED`, is capped below
  `blocking`)
  (a finding that stays actionable keeps its `evidence`; a new objection is a
  new id) are not among them and cannot be: the recorded base is
  `{id: state}`, not the prior fields they would compare against. Nothing recorded is wrong for want of it, because that rule is
  either the suppressed one or provably never fired, but the replay is those
  four rules and the policy says so rather than claiming all of them;
- an optional corroborating artifact must itself have been ingested with
  metrics attached to its own review span (no chaining), may support exactly
  one derivation (no fan-out), and must be identical to the refused artifact in
  severity, state, classification, authority, evidence, required outcome,
  disposition, affected paths, batch verdict, and cardinality — the only
  permitted delta is the one the declared class names, and that delta must
  really be present.

The verb enforces every one of those checks itself, including the ones its
reader would apply later — the dispatch for `(operation, attempt)` must exist,
be accepted, name the declared span, and that span must be successful and
unmeasured. **A verb that appends to an append-only evidence ledger enforces
every check its reader will apply, because the reader's refusal has no undo:** a
record accepted at write time with a wrong attempt would refuse every later
`validate` and `timing-summary` permanently, and the only recovery would be
hand-editing an append-only ledger.

For the same reason, deriving and then **honestly re-ingesting** the same pass
is not an error. Once the span carries its own measurement, the real numbers
win, the derived record is reported as **superseded** rather than orphaned, and
the run still closes. The operator who did the more honest thing must never be
the one who gets blocked.

A superseded record is not recomputed — supersession entails both that the span
carries metrics and that an accepted ingest named it, so the full check would
refuse twice over conditions that have stopped mattering. But it is not
unverified either, because it goes on **publishing** its refusal class, its
cause, and its corroboration state in `timing-summary`. Two checks therefore
survive supersession: the pinned journal row must still resolve uniquely, and
both recorded artifacts must still be present at their recorded digests. After
supersession nothing else in the run references those artifacts, so they are
the first thing a cleanup removes — and without this floor that removal would
be silent while the entry kept being published. **Whenever a record's
verification is relaxed, ask immediately what is still being published on the
strength of it.**

Two deliberate divergences from the `record-telemetry-incomplete` precedent,
stated so neither reads as an oversight:

1. **The ingest journal has no duplicate-key refusal.** Re-ingesting a refused
   batch is the normal recovery, so repeated rows for one artifact are the
   expected shape. `derived-metrics.jsonl` does refuse a duplicate
   `(operation, attempt)`, as the telemetry ledger does.
2. **The record is an overlay, not an attach.** The telemetry declaration
   annotates a span that exists and is malformed; this one supplies a value the
   span will never hold, and keeps it visibly derived. `timing-summary` prints
   it in its own `#### Derived review convergence metrics` section and carries
   it in a `derived_review_metrics` projection array, stating that the integers
   were recomputed from artifacts on disk rather than produced by an ingest.

## Candidate drift under an in-flight dispatch

Dispatch-open and terminal amendments record the product candidates bracketing the role. The external watcher captures immediately before launch; a native dispatch passes the freshly computed id to `record-role-dispatch --state opened` before launch and records the terminal amendment only after the role returns. Open attempts remain visibly incomplete when no terminal amendment arrives. Capture failure is recorded as unavailable evidence, never as proof that the product held still.

Every observed product manifest is stored write-once at `candidates/<candidate_id>.json`. An active change requires a review against the current product candidate. Do not rewrite a finding's resolution stamp to pretend the reviewer saw different bytes. Ordinary bookkeeping no longer moves that identity, so there is no drift-acceptance command, exception ledger, or relaxed resolution vocabulary.

The full snapshots used for explicitly reviewed bookkeeping and the declared-authority hashes remain independent checks. Final acceptance requires current product evidence, unchanged full-tree identity during the gate, complete review evidence, and unchanged declared authority. The separate post-bookkeeping handoff gate proves the complete deliverable tree.

## Protocol recovery

Delegated execution uses a three-signal result: child status, artifact
freshness, and terminal stream completeness are recorded independently.
Ordinary success requires all three plus the role's exact output shape.

Exit 66 (`completed-unverified-protocol`) means only that a successful child
left a fresh artifact while its terminal stream was incomplete. Before using
that artifact, the orchestrator must validate its verdict/report shape, ingest
and validate its evidence block when the role produces findings, and confirm
the expected candidate id. If any check fails, use the normal stage fallback.
Exit 65, a timeout, a nonzero child, a stale artifact, or an invalid artifact
is never recoverable success.

## Measurement and privacy

Record direct facts already carried by the evidence: packet bytes and hashes,
changed-path count, finding counts/states/reopenings/classifications, gate
results, candidate ids, and protocol signals. Record unavailable data as
`unknown`; never infer a reassuring category.

For every accepted Plan Review and Code Review dispatch, finding ingestion
attaches two exact nonnegative integers to that review's intelligence span:
the number of Finding Evidence entries reported on the pass, and the number of
that namespace's actionable findings remaining after reconciliation. An empty
approved evidence block is measured zero, not omitted. These per-pass values
are the durable convergence series; cumulative ledger size is not a substitute.

**`actionable_findings` counts the whole merged ledger, namespace-filtered —
never the batch alone.** After the batch is merged, it is every finding whose id
carries that review namespace and whose state is `open`, `addressed`, or
`blocked-owner`, including entries the batch never mentioned. A rule that
counted only the batch's own non-merging findings gives the same answer whenever
the pre-existing actionable set happens to be empty, and a different one
otherwise; the coincidence is what makes the error survive a spot check. Any
recomputation of this number — by hand, or by `attach-derived-metrics` — must
reproduce the whole-ledger expression, base term included.

Evidence contains repository-relative paths, hashes, findings, and nondisclosing gate results—not
secrets, environment dumps, credentials, ignored private data, or arbitrary
source copies. Project-specific high-assurance profiles may restrict evidence
further; they may not weaken candidate binding or either close gate.

## Trace-bound execution

Schema-3 runs bind `run.json` to one open kickoff trace/root, the initial open
`orchestration.setup` span, review lane, follow-up route, mechanically derived
initial role set, and required orchestration-stage set. Every dispatch is
preceded by an immutable `register-role-attempt` row and atomic handoff.
Validation joins registrations one-to-one with closed intelligence/wait spans,
rejecting omissions, duplicates, metadata drift, gaps, and unregistered spans.

`role-dispatch.jsonl` uses an append-then-amend lifecycle. Immediately before
launch, the watcher appends a `state: opened` row naming the registered attempt,
its intelligence span when available, and the dispatch-open candidate when
capture succeeded. After the child terminates, it appends an accepted or
rejected terminal amendment with the return candidate and completed span
topology. Readers fold the pair. An opening with no amendment is an interrupted
dispatch and makes the run incomplete; it is evidence that work began, not a
malformed row to discard. This opening is the layer that survives an externally
killed watcher.

Teardown hardening is a separate in-process layer. A `PermissionError` from
either the SIGTERM or SIGKILL process-group call, or another cleanup exception,
becomes a diagnostic and cannot prevent span bookkeeping or the terminal
amendment. It does nothing when the watcher itself is externally killed; the
pre-launch opening is what covers that case. Failing to kill is recoverable
through timeout bookkeeping; failing to record is not.

A terminal `record-role-dispatch` with no opening refuses because an external
watcher death would otherwise disappear from the ledger and make an incomplete
trace appear complete. A legitimate recovery must pass
`--no-open-row '<reason>'`; the tool appends that reason to the separate
`dispatch-open-omitted.jsonl` audit artifact, and validation requires the
terminal row and omission record to correspond one-to-one. The opt-out is an
audited exception, not a silent compatibility path.

Sequential reconciliation spans measure setup, planning, implementation,
acceptance, and close preparation. Final timing validation requires the
route-appropriate successful stages, contiguous attempts, no stage overlap,
and close preparation last. Accepted review dispatches must carry the
candidate-bound convergence integers produced by `ingest-findings`. Those
integers attach to the review pass's own intelligence span, so `ingest-findings`
requires `--review-span-id` and refuses without it: a span is immutable once its
trace is finalized, which makes an omission unrepairable after the fact rather
than merely untidy. An ingest that is not a review pass — an orchestrator-authored
state transition with no dispatched span — uses `--no-review-span '<reason>'`,
which records the omission in `review-metrics-omitted.jsonl` rather than leaving
it silent.

Managed gates use `run-gate`; `record-gate` is nonfinal imported evidence only.
Both verbs take exact positional argv after `--` and derive the display command
with `shlex.join`, so a writer cannot emit the noncanonical command/argv pair
that its validator refuses. Historical imported rows with the old whole-command
single-element argv remain readable; validation refuses each by its exact
`gates.jsonl` line, recorded command, argv, and canonical display.
Final eligibility requires a complete matching span, exact argv, unchanged
full-tree identity during the gate, and a current matching product candidate.
`validate --level integrity` checks recorded facts without inventing missing
success events; `validate --level acceptance` additionally requires the full
role topology, convergence measurements, gate joins, resolved findings, and
the final seal. `status` exposes missing acceptance roles and permitted next
actions. One idempotent `close` operation then records exactly one truthful
outcome: accepted, parked, or failed. Non-accepted close requires the complete
failure signature, recovers/finalizes interrupted telemetry, and never claims
acceptance; accepted close requires finalized acceptance evidence before it
appends the exact END block.

Initialization also creates an immutable run-scoped tool bundle containing the
exact evidence binary, candidate tree identifier, telemetry CLI, and telemetry
library plus the external watcher and its `kickoff.yaml`, all covered by one
hash manifest. Every later operation in that run uses those
pinned executables; the evidence binary rejects access through a mutable live
copy. A phase may therefore change its own construction machinery without
stranding the active run. The bundle is a same-run snapshot and never a
historical schema reader or migration shim.

## Prospective ledger transition at accepted close

The accepted `close` interface supports `--ledger-after <file>` and, for separately accepted parent completion, `--parent-run <run>`. The external proposal changes only the closing phase's active marker to completed, optionally including its independently accepted parent's marker. Declared authority remains unchanged through acceptance. The closure identity binds the proposal's before/after digests, accepted product and parent closure identity when present. Invalid or conflicting transitions refuse before log mutation. The same close command with `--verify-handoff` verifies the applied ledger and product; this checkpoint precedes further bookkeeping and never replaces the handoff gate. See [phase-status.md](phase-status.md) for continuation requirements.

A prospective close may additionally advance at most one existing not-started phase to next, selected in dependency order during close preparation. This exact marker transition is bound with the completion markers; it prevents a final-child close from creating an idle incomplete ledger without a next phase.

Primary continuations carry advice with `carry-advice --source-run <prior-run>` and record a fresh final-delta decision. Original reports remain joined to their original read-only dispatches; phase-wide launch counts do not reset. Primary acceptance captures the assessed bookkeeping snapshot, while declared-authority protection and post-gate non-mutation remain mandatory.
