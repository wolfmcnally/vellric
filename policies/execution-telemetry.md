# Policy: Execution Telemetry and Phase Reports

Authority mode follows [four-canonical-agents.md](four-canonical-agents.md). Product primary mode uses independent advice and primary acceptance; delegated product mode retains approval verdicts and bounded revision loops. References below to reviewer assent or mandatory re-review govern delegated work only. Required objective gates and truthful evidence apply in both modes. All methodology work, including teach/learn, follows [review-lanes.md](review-lanes.md): one-shot by the primary, no delegated production or review, and commit/fast-forward-push authority after required checks.

Kickoff execution timing is exact, candidate-bound, privacy-bounded, and
machine-owned. It measures elapsed work; it does not replace narrative logs,
status events, gate evidence, or human judgment about whether an optimization
is worthwhile.

## Exact schemas

Durable records use closed schemas:

- `agentic_starter.execution_span.v1` for one closed span;
- `agentic_starter.execution_trace.v1` for one finalized trace bundle; and
- `agentic_starter.operator_park_event.v1` for a phase-level required-user-input
  open or close event.

Unknown keys or enum members, malformed identifiers, missing required values,
booleans where integers are required, invalid parentage, and intervals outside
their parents fail validation. A trace has exactly one `run` root. Child
categories are `intelligence`, `gate`, `reconciliation`, and `wait`.
Outcomes are `success`, `error`, `timeout`, `cancelled`, or
`interrupted`.

Operator-park events carry only event kind, UUID, dotted phase id, stable reason
code, UTC timestamp, boot identity, and monotonic reading. Stable reasons are
`approval`, `decision`, `manual-check`, `environment-action`, `acceptance`, and
`required-input`. Question text, responses, prompts, paths, and arbitrary prose
have no schema field.

Review spans may carry nonnegative `findings_reported` and
`actionable_findings`, attached only by validated finding ingestion. These
values are never estimated. `findings_reported` is the number of validated
entries in that pass's Finding Evidence block; `actionable_findings` is the
number of findings in the **whole merged ledger** — not the batch alone —
whose id carries that review namespace and whose post-reconciliation state is
still `open`, `addressed`, or `blocked-owner`. An approved empty block records
zero. Final timing validation rejects an accepted review pass without both
integers, unless the run carries a recomputed derived-metrics overlay for it
(`policies/orchestration-evidence.md § Derived convergence metrics for a
refused batch`); the span itself is never written after the fact.

## Clock and accounting contract

Within a trace, UTC timestamps exist for correlation only. Every span duration
comes from `time.monotonic_ns()`. Durable offsets are exact nanoseconds relative
to the root:

```text
duration_ns = end_offset_ns - start_offset_ns
```

Aggregation uses interval unions and exclusive attribution. Nested or
overlapping spans are never summed and presented as elapsed time. Reports keep
these concepts separate:

- active root makespan;
- calendar window across same-phase attempts;
- summed measured work;
- exclusive work by activity;
- failed and retry work;
- peak concurrency;
- orchestration/unmeasured remainder and measured gaps.

A delegated `wait` span mirrors the intelligence interval; it is not a second
unit of work and never inflates the report.

Phase-level **operator parks** are separate from traces and `wait` spans. Open a
park immediately before stopping for required user input; close it only when a
response satisfies that wait. A park may span finalized traces. When open and
close share a proven boot identity, its duration is exact monotonic time. Across
a reboot, its duration is UTC calendar time labeled **non-exact**. If the UTC
order is invalid, the duration is unavailable—not zero. Per-phase totals are
interval unions; overlapping parks never double-count.

Kickoff traces prospectively cover sequential
`orchestration.setup`, `orchestration.planning`,
`orchestration.implementation`, `orchestration.acceptance`, and
`orchestration.close` stages. Re-entry increments an attempt. Validation
rejects missing stages, overlaps, unknown names, noncontiguous attempts,
out-of-order close, unregistered roles, bad role/wait joins, stale gate joins,
or accepted review passes without convergence counts.

## Runtime state, durability, and recovery

Open traces live outside the repository at:

```text
${AGENTIC_STARTER_EXECUTION_TELEMETRY_DIR:-${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/agentic-starter/execution-telemetry}/<repo-key>/<trace-id>/
```

The append-only operator-park ledger and its recoverable open-state files live
under the same external `<repo-key>/` root. An event is appended and fsynced
before the open-state cache is written; a missing cache is reconstructed from
the ledger. Duplicate same-identity opens and closes are idempotent.
Conflicting, unmatched, or multiply-open state fails closed.

Mutations take an exclusive lock. Files are written through same-directory
temporary files, flushed, fsynced, and atomically replaced. The durable
repository ledger is `EXECUTION_LOG.jsonl`; it receives only finalized,
canonical compact JSON.

Finalization requires a closed root, no open descendants, valid intervals,
valid scope ownership, and an exact privacy projection. Appending is
idempotent only for a byte-equivalent trace with the same id. Invalid UTF-8,
unterminated JSONL, or a conflicting prior trace fails before append.

Recovery may close descendants deepest-first and the root last only when the
stored and current boot identities are provably the same. A changed or unknown
boot leaves the trace incomplete. Recovery never invents cross-boot duration,
turns missing measurement into zero, or changes failure into success.

## Observed commands and failure truth

Observed commands preserve child stdout, stderr, and normalized status:

- exit 0 → success;
- positive exit → error;
- signal → interrupted;
- wrapper SIGINT/SIGTERM → cancelled;
- command/first-event/idle/hard deadline → timeout;
- spawn failure → error 127.

Cancellation and timeout terminate the process group and check for surviving
descendants. Telemetry failure is diagnosed independently and never masks the
underlying command result. Missing instrumentation may preserve a successful
child result, but it blocks a claim of complete execution evidence.

Kickoff gate commands run through `kickoff-evidence run-gate`, which binds
exact argv, selection rationale, before/after candidate identity, child result,
warning count, diagnostic digest, and the observed gate span.

## Privacy projection

Sanitization is projection, not redaction. Trace and operator-park records have no generic
metadata bag and no place for prompts, responses, reasoning, command
arguments, environment, stdout/stderr, exception bodies, credentials,
absolute paths, home-relative paths, private source material, or arbitrary
prose. Runtime state may contain local roots needed to enforce ownership; it
never enters the durable projection. Fixtures are synthetic.

## Deterministic phase report

The accepted trace and every earlier finalized same-phase attempt feed a
chronological offline archive under `reports/execution/`. The default view
answers:

- what landed and how to try it;
- where active elapsed time went;
- which activities and automated checks were longest;
- which checks failed or repeated;
- whether Plan Review and Code Review converged;
- how much retry and failed work occurred;
- where instrumentation is absent;
- every interval and the union total spent awaiting required user input,
  including an exact/non-exact basis;
- what phase is next and what the operator should do.

Default labels are Planning, Plan Review, Implementation, Code Review,
Automated Checks, Awaiting User Input, and Orchestration / Unmeasured. Operator
parks remain separate from both work and unmeasured orchestration. Charts use readable minutes;
machine payloads and exact tables retain nanoseconds. Root wrappers, internal
ids, model names, harness names, and wait mirrors stay out of the default
presentation.

The archive is fully offline: data and presentation are separate files,
network access is denied by CSP, ECharts 6.1.0 and its Apache license are
vendored, and no fetch/XHR/WebSocket/eval or inline event handler is allowed.
The same trace ledger, accepted trace, operator-park summary, and handoff must
regenerate byte-identically.

The handoff schema is
`agentic_starter.execution_dashboard_handoff.v1`:

```json
{
  "schema": "agentic_starter.execution_dashboard_handoff.v1",
  "phase_id": "1.2",
  "what_just_landed": [{"title": "...", "detail": "..."}],
  "see_for_yourself": [{"title": "...", "steps": ["..."], "expected": "..."}],
  "coming_up_next": {"phase_id": "1.3", "title": "...", "summary": "..."},
  "recommended_steps": [{"title": "...", "detail": "...", "kind": "action"}]
}
```

`coming_up_next` may be null. Recommendation kinds are `action`,
`blocking`, and `ready`. The handoff contains only accepted outcomes,
concrete safe demos, applied next-phase state, and genuine prerequisites. It
never discusses commit state or embeds arbitrary HTML.

`bin/check-execution-dashboards` is a read-only gate. It validates static
assets, schema, digests, chronology, navigation, privacy, CSP, and
byte-identical regeneration. A report-generation failure after trace
finalization blocks the handoff gate; repair or regenerate the current
uncommitted close and retry idempotently. A browser-open failure after the
handoff gate is presentation-only and does not change tracked artifacts.

When dashboard presentation changes, deterministic checks are insufficient.
Serve it with `bin/serve-execution-dashboard`, inspect archive and phase pages
at desktop and mobile widths, exercise trace selection, zoom, disclosure, and
navigation, compare charts with tables, and check the browser console. Blank
charts, clipped labels, misleading hierarchy, or DOM-only interactions fail.

## Phase-close ordering

Kickoff closes in this order:

1. unchanged approved implementation candidate passes its changed-path gate;
2. evidence and exact timing validate;
3. telemetry finalizes;
4. status, ripple, and lessons update;
5. END log and sanitized report land;
6. bare `./bin/check all` passes against the actual handoff tree and writes its
   ignored receipt;
7. delivery — the ordinary commit and non-force push of gate-proved work,
   unless the operator restricted it ([`human-in-the-loop.md`](human-in-the-loop.md))
   — and the read-only opening of the already-generated report may follow.

No tracked write follows step 6; step 7 changes no tracked content. A step-5 or
step-6 failure reopens the current uncommitted close; completion is not reported
until the handoff gate passes.
