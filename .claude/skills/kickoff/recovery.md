# Kickoff — Recovery, parks and follow-ups

## Authority-mode interpretation

Read the frozen workflow mode. Product primary mode dispatches only independent advisory reviewers, retains planning/coding on the invoking instance, and accepts through a current primary decision plus required checks. A reviewer verdict or remaining suggestion cannot block it. Second review/critique requires recorded cause; two passes per stage is the maximum across continuations. Candidate changes require truthful delta assessment and fresh tests, not mandatory additional advice. Delegated product mode retains the approval/revision procedures below. Methodology work follows the separate primary one-shot route with no delegated role or independent review and with commit/push authority after required checks.


Read this resource before executing its branch. Enter through [SKILL.md](SKILL.md); its resource table defines the order. Before resuming a stage, read its resource again when continuity is uncertain.

## Follow-up entry

A follow-up correction exists only after the affected implementation has received its initial code-critic pass. An approved preparation/qualification continuation instead enters through [Planned continuation](#planned-continuation) below. For a correction, inspect the diagnostic or user instruction and the likely change surface, then classify both risk and size per [`policies/review-lanes.md`](../../../policies/review-lanes.md):

- **Direct fix** (small and low risk): the orchestrator edits the localized code itself. Skip role resolution/preflight and Steps 3–6; validate through Steps 7–8.
- **Coder only** (low risk, but implementation delegation is useful): run Steps 0a–0c, invoke Step 5, skip Step 6, then validate through Steps 7–8.
- **Full cycle** (high risk or large/cross-cutting): run Steps 0a–0c and the normal coder → critic path in Steps 5–8. Re-run planning first only when the correction exposes a plan or architecture error.

Before any follow-up, read [preflight.md](preflight.md) for the required Step 1b evidence initialization even when live role preflight is skipped. Read [acceptance.md](acceptance.md) before validation and [close.md](close.md) before terminal bookkeeping, the handoff gate or delivery. Delegated paths additionally read [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) and [implementation.md](implementation.md); planning escalation reads [planning.md](planning.md). These loads precede the corresponding actions, not merely the final report.

For a delegated follow-up, use the concrete diagnostic or user instruction, the phase file, and the prior END block as the correction brief for Steps 5–6; do not depend on an ephemeral plan from an earlier session. If those sources do not determine the correction safely, classify it as high risk and re-run planning.

Do not turn an uncertain correction into a direct fix: uncertainty about behavior, blast radius, or validation makes it high risk. For a follow-up during an active phase, continue through the normal Steps 9–10 after validation. If the prior phase is already `✅`, skip Steps 2 and 9 and do not emit the normal Step 10 END block; preserve its status and historical END block, then append an `END (correction)` block and report the route and evidence per [`policies/log-discipline.md`](../../../policies/log-discipline.md). A concrete correction does not reopen the phase, while genuinely new scope belongs in a new phase.

Every route still initializes Step 1b evidence. For a direct fix, the orchestrator writes the same exact Change Evidence JSON object the coder would have reported and passes it to `capture-change --metadata`; direct authorship does not bypass candidate identity, risk tags, selection rationale, or final gate records.

## Planned continuation

Apply [the approved-plan continuation rule](../../../policies/review-lanes.md#continue-an-approved-plan-after-preparation) before restarting an expressly approved preparation/qualification sequence. Verify the preserved approved plan, approval, authority diff and candidate lineage; identify completed work, real remaining work, focused results and every unresolved finding. If the policy's eligibility conditions fail, use fresh planning and independent plan review rather than this branch.

After the truthful preparation park and final authority edits, read [preflight.md](preflight.md) and initialize a fresh run with `--follow-up-route full-cycle`, retaining the resolved review and evidence lanes. This existing route derives coder and critic attempts without a new planning stage. Put the preserved plan and hash, approval and the verified continuation evidence in the continuation brief; do not invent fresh planning or review records. Read [dispatch.md](dispatch.md) and [implementation.md](implementation.md), then run Steps 5–8 using that brief. Tell the critic to check continuation eligibility and review the entire diff from HEAD against the preserved plan and current authorities. Ineligible continuation requires a truthful park and fresh planning/review; do not insert a late planning stage into this run.

Before dispatching the continuation coder, append `START (resumed)` through preflight Step 2, naming the preserved preparation and plan. Close `orchestration.setup` successfully, recompute the candidate through `$EVIDENCE_TOOL current-candidate`, and open `orchestration.implementation` directly; do not open or close an omitted planning stage. This remains the same incomplete phase: preserve its in-progress marker and close through [acceptance.md](acceptance.md) and [close.md](close.md), including Steps 9–10 and the normal END block. Record the preparation and continuation relationship, actual roles and preserved approval; never report preparation as acceptance or use the historical-phase correction format.

### Operator-input parks (applies throughout)

Phase-level time awaiting required user input is not a role `wait` span and may cross trace finalization or a machine reboot. Immediately before stopping for an approval, decision, manual check, environment action, acceptance judgment, or other required input, run:

```
$TELEMETRY_TOOL park-open --phase "$PHASE_ID" --reason <stable-reason-code>
```

Use only the enumerated reason codes shown by the CLI; never record the question, response, prompt, repository content, or private data. Preserve the returned park id. On the continuation that receives an answer satisfying the wait, close it **before resuming phase work**:

```
$TELEMETRY_TOOL park-close --phase "$PHASE_ID" --park-id <park-id>
```

Repeated open/close calls are idempotent for the same identity; a conflicting, missing, or multiply-open park fails closed. `phase-summary` reports each interval and its union total. Same-boot intervals use exact monotonic time; cross-boot intervals use visibly non-exact UTC calendar duration. Never turn an open, malformed, or unknowable interval into zero.

When the run must terminate in a truthful PARK rather than merely keep the turn open, harvest the available sensor feed immediately using Step 9c's file-or-recur rules, validate the ledger, and append a PARK block through `bin/log-append`. The block names the reason, preserved evidence, resume condition, and a literal `Lessons:` section. Do not postpone a failed attempt's learning until a future END.

## Native execution limits

Absent named subagents does not authorize substituting the orchestrator for a selected model or reviewing its own work in the same context. Follow [governed recovery](../../../policies/role-models.md#governed-recovery); retain canonical role procedures, tool stances and verdict formats in any admissible venue.

- Fail-closed park and diagnosed resume ([`policies/fail-closed-resume.md`](../../../policies/fail-closed-resume.md)): any first-encountered defect finishes the run truthfully — dispatches stopped, spans closed with the failure outcome, artifacts preserved, candidate restoration or lineage proved — and records a five-part failure signature in the phase's append-only `.kickoff/failure-signatures.jsonl` ledger. A **novel**, fully diagnosed signature with a recorded causal correction may open a fresh corrective trace against the phase's self-resume budget (`kickoff.yaml` `run_budgets.self_resume`, shipped default 3, restored by any operator relay; `0` pins every park to the operator). A **recurring** signature always stops for the operator. Prelaunch dispatcher rejections are corrected-and-relaunched at most once without consuming budget. Sealing is a close-time act: never re-run whole-repository sealing per fix inside a convergence loop.

- `ingest-findings` **requires `--review-span-id`** and refuses without it. The convergence integers attach to the review pass's own intelligence span, and a span is immutable once the trace is finalized — so an omitted flag makes `timing-summary` refuse for the entire run and cannot be repaired afterward. Preserve each reviewer's and critic's intelligence span id when you dispatch it. For an ingest that is genuinely **not** a review pass — most commonly the orchestrator recording an `open → addressed` transition after a *plan* revision, since `phase-planner` emits a revised plan rather than a `## Finding Evidence` block — pass `--no-review-span '<reason>'`, which records the omission in `review-metrics-omitted.jsonl` instead of hiding it.

## Context continuity

Before a capacity pause or compaction continuation, read [the context brief](../../../briefs/session-context-compaction.md). Use measured session capacity and comparable arc evidence; unknown capacity is unknown. Externalize exact plan/candidate/findings and actual run state at a safe boundary, then re-read active instructions and the next stage resource on continuation. Lost trustworthy continuity requires complete review; authority drift requires a truthful park and fresh capture. Do not add hooks, change permissions or infer CLI capacity from an API setting.

For a fresh primary-mode continuation run, use `kickoff-evidence carry-advice --run-dir <new-run> --source-run <prior-run>` after initialization. It preserves original report/candidate/dispatch provenance and the phase-wide pass allowance. Record a fresh primary decision about the final delta; an old decision is not acceptance of new bytes. Keep prior evidence available. A failed second advisory invocation does not authorize a third under another run directory.
