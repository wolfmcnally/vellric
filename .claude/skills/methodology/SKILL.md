# The Agentic Coding Methodology

## Primary ownership and independent advice

As of 2026-09-07, the primary use case is a configured SOTA instance that owns orchestration, planning, implementation and acceptance. A comparable or stronger model in another permitted provider's harness normally supplies independent plan and code advice; a single-provider environment uses fresh instances of the primary model. One comprehensive pass per stage is normal, a second needs recorded cause, and two is the maximum. Advisers report evidence and severity without veto; the primary decides corrections and records consequential dispositions. Objective requirements and both close gates remain binding.

A constrained primary uses separate planner/coder roles and the established approval-gated reviewer/critic loops. Detailed references to mandatory reviewer approval or four-role delegation below describe that constrained product branch. Eligibility is maintained configuration, not a benchmark claim. Backend and handling restrictions prevail over preferred routing. Optional kickoff usage checks refuse a primary at >=95% of any applicable limit and substitute the primary for a secondary above 95% weekly; absent tooling does not prevent execution.

All methodology work itself, including teach/learn knowledge transfer, is always one-shot by the invoking primary across harnesses and capability tiers, without delegated production or independent review. The primary owns adaptation, self-checks, required gates, commit and fast-forward push within authorized scope. This standing delivery grant does not expand scope or waive custody and human decisions. No product phase or repeated approval ceremony is needed for authorized methodology work.


A methodology for writing software with AI coding agents in a way that scales beyond ad-hoc prompting. Each step involves conversing with or using LLMs. Apply it when scoping or structuring a coding project — not when answering one-off coding questions.

## Rule One surrounds the sequence

The eleven steps govern forward construction. Rule One governs what happens when any step—or any other kind of work—goes wrong or not as expected: treat the observed condition as a symptom, diagnose the causal contribution system proportionately, distinguish containment from correction and prevention, and persist any reusable lesson on a durable cross-harness surface. The operative skill is [`.claude/skills/rule-one/SKILL.md`](../rule-one/SKILL.md); the reasoning and open diagnostic questions live in [`briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md`](../../../briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md). They are one methodology unit and must travel together through `learn` and `teach`.

## The eleven steps

1. **Vague ideas → insights.** Turn vague ideas into insights, including competitive analysis. What problem are you actually solving? Who has already tried? What do you need to learn before committing?

2. **Insights → brief.** Turn the insights into a brief: *what* to build. The brief lives under `briefs/`.

3. **Brief → architecture document.** Decide *how*. Research Best Current Practices (BCPs) for each technical aspect: libraries, protocols, data formats, platform conventions. Lives under `briefs/` or `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

4. **Repo-level policies.** Codify standards and practices. Lives under `policies/`. Every phase honors every policy.

5. **Brief + architecture → phased plan.** Break the work down by phase. Each phase is independently testable and has a clearly defined goal and acceptance criteria. Lives under `plan/`; the spine is `plan/INDEX.md`.

6. **Coherent outcomes; conditional children.** Apply the boundary test in `briefs/methodology.md` §6: an unresolved consequential decision, independently accepted prerequisite, deployment/migration/human seam or demonstrated coherence limit can justify decomposition. Keep coherent changes intact across modules, tests and docs; absent children, session length and model reputation are not triggers. Route consequential decisions to the operator. Once a split is authorized, draft children just in time, one at a time; do not pre-decompose future major phases.

7. **Orchestrator-driven phase execution.** Use the high-level `kickoff` orchestrator skill (`/kickoff` in Claude Code; `$kickoff` in Codex), which keeps implementation inline in primary mode and delegates it in constrained mode. It:
   - selects the current phase and freezes the authority mode and permitted model routes;
   - plans and codes inline in primary mode, obtaining the required independent advice;
   - records primary dispositions and requests a second advisory pass only for recorded cause, never a third;
   - in constrained delegated mode, dispatches planner, reviewer, coder, and critic under the established bounded approval loops.

8. **Acceptance check.** The primary or delegated coder runs focused behavioral checks during implementation. The primary then runs the required sequence ending in the changed-path selection, the implementation-candidate gate. After accepted close and all tracked bookkeeping, it runs the one bare full handoff gate, which qualifies the push. No tracked write follows success. Changed implementation invalidates prior gates. Follow-ups use their risk and size classification without automatically requiring another advisory pass. Methodology work always uses direct primary self-inspection, targeted checks before each local commit, and one full gate before the push.

9. **Append-only phase log and lessons harvest.** `LOG.md` opens and closes work on every phase. Closing requires recorded evidence plus the mandatory lessons question: harvest role Process Observations, revision failure analyses, wall-clock observations, and relevant dispositions into `lessons/`; `None` is valid, omission is not.

10. **Human evaluation where judgment is required.** Objective criteria may close autonomously after their applicable review contract and complete gates, and the phase is delivered. Named manual, subjective, product, custody, or owner-only criteria still park for the human, who evaluates each phase at the seam. Delivery never substitutes for that judgment.

11. **Stay agile.** Add new phases, or break existing phases into more sub-phases, as the problem and solution space become clearer.

## How to apply this methodology

- If you have only a vague idea, push to step 1.
- If a brief exists but no architecture, do step 3 and research BCPs.
- If architecture exists but no phase plan, do step 5.
- At phase entry, apply step 6’s boundary test; absent children alone require no action.
- If a phase or authorized child is being executed, follow step 7's `kickoff` orchestrator pattern.
- Whenever a phase opens or closes, write to the append-only log (step 9) with explicit evidence; at close, run the lessons harvest and surface graduation-ready candidates for human ratification.

## The four canonical agents

The orchestrator delegates to four specialist roles. Their names are load-bearing:

| Role | Reads | Writes code | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phase-planner` | Briefs, plan, repo | No | Turn one phase into a file-level implementation plan |
| `plan-reviewer` | Briefs, plan, repo, plan output | No | Approve the plan or send it back for revision |
| `phase-coder` | Briefs, plan, repo, approved plan | Yes | Implement the approved plan and run focused iteration checks |
| `code-critic` | Briefs, plan, repo, code diff | No | Approve the code or send it back for revision |

## Non-negotiables

- **Every completed phase is incremental and testable.**
- **Prefer conceptual economy.** Among designs that satisfy the same requirements and invariants, choose the one that leaves fewer independent concepts, states, paths, representations, authorities, and exceptions for the next reader to understand; never substitute line, file, or abstraction counts for that judgment. See [`policies/simplicity-and-consolidation.md`](../../../policies/simplicity-and-consolidation.md).
- **Every initial product implementation receives the review required by its lane; primary-mode critique is advisory and delegated-mode critique is approval-gated.**
- **Review, findings, and gates are bound to exact candidate identity.**
- **Revision rounds use causal packets and widen when continuity is uncertain.**
- **The orchestrator owns both close gates, including the one full run; the coder owns focused iteration.**
- **The human owns subjective and owner-only acceptance; objective acceptance satisfies its review contract and is gate-proved.**
- **The primary plans and codes inline in primary mode and for all methodology work; constrained product work delegates those roles.**
- **Closing a phase requires recorded evidence and a lessons-harvest answer.**
- **Unstarted phases and authorized children are mutable; completed phases stay completed.**

## Orchestration runtime doctrine

Hard-won rules for step 7 when the loop runs fail-closed and unattended:

- **Fail-closed park, diagnosed self-resume.** Any first-encountered defect halts the run and writes an honest park record. A halt whose cause is *novel* for the phase, fully diagnosed with a recorded causal correction, and whose integrity proofs pass may self-resume without waiting for the human — against a small budget (three between human contacts is a working default). A *recurring* cause class always stops for the human: recurrence means a generator the cure didn't reach.
- **Never round-trip deterministic work through a model.** Bookkeeping rebases, identifier substitutions, and small revisions to large documents are orchestrator-performed, byte-diff-proven transforms; the displaced model role reviews the result instead of producing it.
- **No artifact larger than one model response travels a single-message channel.** Large documents are revised by delta plus deterministic merge; a model asked to re-emit a big document verbatim will summarize or paginate it, and either way the artifact is wrong.
- **Qualify every measuring instrument outside the evidentiary run** before it gates anything: exercise every branch, prove aim, and prove falsifiability (a deliberately wrong probe must fail). An assertion that can only pass is not evidence.
- **Embed every contract verbatim in the dispatch prompt**, rendered from the enforcing source — never model memory, never prose inference.
- **Designed human checkpoints are satisfying stops**, enumerated in advance. Every other stop is classified before it is cured — legitimate park, defect, contract mismatch, or model behavior — because each class takes a different fix, and retrying a generator-class cause can never converge.
- **Run an out-of-band supervisor** for long orchestrations: a second session with no write access to the worker's context that verifies claims against ground truth and drafts human-ratified steering, compiling incidents into standing rules.
- **Choose the weakest instrument that can falsify the defect class under test** — retire instruments when a design change eliminates their defect class; every instrument repair first re-asks whether the measured property still needs measuring. Altitude has a time axis: before repairing, check the roadmap for a scheduled change that obsoletes the repaired surface — a fix for what the plan deletes is the ratchet in a new coat.
- **Every falsification control must itself be provably satisfiable** — the wrong probe must fail for its intended reason AND the specified control must be able to succeed under the declared comparator; check at specification time.
- **A machine check fully shadowed by a designed human gate defaults to advisory** — recording rights, not parking rights.
- **Structure every ratification artifact orientation-first** — human gates degrade under density, not just volume ("approval snow blindness"): plain-language beats first, fixed decision-payload position, producer owns legibility, receiver read-back as the forcing function.
- **Preflight the environment before an unattended run** — a fail-closed probe ladder (repo baseline, identity, toolchain, platform capabilities, escalation mechanics, authoritative gate as pre-work baseline) runs before the tasking prompt; probes read-only or self-cleaning with a printed table; barriers surface one layer per round; fixes land as durable config, never session memory; after a green baseline, every failure is the run's own.
- **Well-specified isolated tasks may run as goal-armed one-shots** instead of the four-role loop — complete operator-reviewed spec (substitutes for plan review), new-files-only write set with a park on widening, designed parks as satisfying stops, a durable goal carrying outcome + printed proof + park clause, independent verification against the recorded baseline before push. Goal durability is harness-specific — know whether compaction clears it before trusting continuation to it.
- **Authoritative gates run in the native execution context** — sandboxed gate output can contain phantom failures in either direction; classify sandbox-vs-real with one native baseline before work; a gate that could not run is "not run," never "passed"; never cite in-sandbox gate output as evidence.
- **Stop an outward spiral at its premise.** A defensive requirement joins the target only when an observed failure, explicit operator decision, or actually-targeted platform contract supports it. On revision, judge whether a finding deepens the work inside the fixed target or invents a larger target; unsupported premises park for the operator before another implementation pass. Counts describe the trajectory but do not decide it.
- **Doctrine and ceremony grow only against incidents, and every review prunes** — a new binding step enters only with its motivating incident cited and the park it prevents named; foresight proposals stay in the `lessons/` ledger, never become rules; every review pass (plan review, code review, `sweep`) treats steps whose failure families are structurally dead as deletion candidates, because fail-closed pressure ratchets ceremony and only deliberate pruning reverses it.

## Run-lifecycle vocabulary

- **Finalized** — lifecycle closed, outcome recorded, failure included.
- **Sealed** — passed its acceptance gate; digest-bound, immutable, cited downstream. Working shorthand for supply-chain *attestation*: git commits are the substrate (a commit seals *what*; a seal adds *why you may rely on it*); working-state tree hashes (`bin/kickoff-tree-id`) seal the uncommitted interval. Seal at every trust boundary; keep the sealer cheap enough that ubiquity is free.
- **Frozen** — tooling made byte-identical and read-only under a recorded manifest, so later runs provably execute the qualified instrument.
- **Parked** — the run-level stop discipline (written causal account, nothing disturbed, clean proven scene, explicit resume conditions) — distinct from interrupt/pause, checkpoint, and halt.

**Enforcement status:** mostly doctrine — self-resume budgets are mechanized (`policies/fail-closed-resume.md`; `kickoff.yaml` `run_budgets.self_resume` via `bin/kickoff-config`), while delta-merge tooling and qualification harnesses remain prose-and-relay.
