"""The closed vocabularies of a review finding, and the schema derived from them.

These sets are the validator's. They live here rather than inside
`bin/kickoff-evidence` so that the tool which *checks* a finding and the tool
which *constrains its generation* read the same definition — a second copy is
the defect this module exists to remove.

**Why constrain at generation.** Validation used to run only after the
reviewing agent had exited, so the cheapest possible repair — one more turn
saying "invalid severity, re-emit" — was unavailable, and a single invented
token cost a whole review. It happened three times in one phase: a blank line
after a heading discarded seven plan findings; an `open → verified` transition
discarded nine; the severity token `major` discarded five blocking findings
after a 73-turn, ~13-minute, $8.67 critique. In every case the reviewer did
substantively correct work and the evidence layer threw it away on a format
technicality. An enum-constrained field cannot emit `major`, and a JSON payload
has no markdown envelope to get wrong, so both failure modes stop being
categories rather than being caught later.

**What the schema deliberately does not carry.** The emitted document stays
inside the strict structured-output subset both vendors accept: object types,
closed `enum`s, `items`, an exhaustive `required` list, and
`additionalProperties: false`. It carries no `pattern`, no `minLength`, and no
bare optional properties — an optional field is typed `["string", "null"]` and
still listed as required, which is how strict mode expresses optionality.

That subset cannot express finding-id shape, candidate-hash shape, non-empty
text, or transition legality. Those remain with `kickoff-evidence`'s validator,
which stays in the dispatch path as defense in depth. The division is the point:
the schema owns what a vocabulary can state, the validator owns what only a
run's own history can decide.

**Why there is no `$schema` key.** The two venues disagree about it. Codex's
`--output-schema` accepts the document either way; Claude's `--json-schema`
treats the value as a meta-schema reference it must already hold and rejects
the document outright when it cannot resolve it. Emitting the draft 2020-12
URI therefore made every Claude-venue review die in under a second, before the
model ran — and under a Codex-orchestrated kickoff the shipped routing sends
both review roles there. The key constrains nothing the vendors read, so the
schema simply does not carry it.
