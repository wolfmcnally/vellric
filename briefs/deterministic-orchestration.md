# Deterministic Orchestration of the Kickoff Loop

## Primary ownership and independent advice

As of 2026-09-07, the primary use case is a configured SOTA instance that owns orchestration, planning, implementation and acceptance. A comparable or stronger model in another permitted provider's harness normally supplies independent plan and code advice; a single-provider environment uses fresh instances of the primary model. One comprehensive pass per stage is normal, a second needs recorded cause, and two is the maximum. Advisers report evidence and severity without veto; the primary decides corrections and records consequential dispositions. Objective requirements and both close gates remain binding.

A constrained primary uses separate planner/coder roles and the established approval-gated reviewer/critic loops. Detailed references to mandatory reviewer approval or four-role delegation below describe that constrained product branch. Eligibility is maintained configuration, not a benchmark claim. Backend and handling restrictions prevail over preferred routing. Optional kickoff usage checks refuse a primary at >=95% of any applicable limit and substitute the primary for a secondary above 95% weekly; absent tooling does not prevent execution.

All methodology work itself, including teach/learn knowledge transfer, is always one-shot by the invoking primary across harnesses and capability tiers, without delegated production or independent review. The primary owns adaptation, self-checks, required gates, commit and fast-forward push within authorized scope. This standing delivery grant does not expand scope or waive custody and human decisions. No product phase or repeated approval ceremony is needed for authorized methodology work.


This brief proposes — and deliberately defers — moving `kickoff`'s control flow from prose executed by the orchestrating model to a deterministic workflow program executed by the harness. It exists so the decision can be made quickly when its trigger condition lands, rather than re-derived from scratch.

The candidate-bound evidence plane in [`incremental-orchestration.md`](incremental-orchestration.md) is implemented independently of this deferral. Authority, change, finding, gate, packet, and protocol records are the data plane a future workflow program should consume; they do not require moving today's control flow out of prose.

## 1. Problem

`kickoff` is a state machine written in prose. The orchestrating model reads the compact `.claude/skills/kickoff/SKILL.md` entry, then explicitly reads each linked adjacent resource before performing its stage: classify initial work versus a follow-up correction, resolve venue (Step 0a), resolve phase and lane (Step 1), apply the consequential outcome-boundary test and decompose only when authorized (`preflight.md` Step 1a), delegate to the needed roles, parse verdicts by string match, route follow-ups by risk and size, run convergence-based full revision loops (a judgment call — iterate while objections narrow, escalate on stall or divergence — bounded by a deterministic 10-cycle runaway backstop), run the cross-harness fallback state machine, run the ripple pass, assemble the END block.

Field use across this template and its derived projects shows the prose machine executing faithfully — END blocks match status flips, revision caps hold, fallbacks degrade gracefully. But the state count has grown monotonically: venue resolution, per-stage fallback, turn-cap rescue, review lanes with escalation, proportional follow-up routing, AUTO/DECIDE ripple classification. Prose execution risk grows with the number of states the orchestrating model must track, and every addition is paid on every phase. The known failure classes — none yet observed at damaging scale, all structurally possible — are: a skipped step, a mis-parsed verdict (`## Verdict:` is matched by string, and any deviation from that exact header breaks orchestration), an under-classified follow-up, a forgotten ripple pass, a revision loop that loses count, venue thrash after a fallback.

## 2. What a deterministic encoding buys

- **Control flow in code.** Loops, caps, timeouts, and the fallback state machine become mechanical — incapable of being forgotten, miscounted, or reordered.
- **Schema-validated verdicts.** A structured-output contract (`{verdict: "APPROVED" | "REVISE", required_changes: [...]}`) replaces string matching. The reviewer model is *forced* into the shape; malformed verdicts become retries at the tool layer instead of orchestration breaks.
- **Resumability.** A journaled workflow re-runs from the first changed step after an interruption, instead of the human reconstructing where the prose machine stopped.
- **Cheaper orchestration.** The orchestrating model spends judgment on content (what the critic found, what ripples mean) rather than bookkeeping (which step, which count, which venue).
- **Native consumption of existing evidence.** The program validates and routes the already-shipped candidate, finding, gate, and protocol records instead of inventing a second workflow-specific state format.

## 3. What stays model-driven

The program orchestrates; it does not judge. These remain model (or human) work:

- The four roles' actual work — planning, reviewing, coding, critiquing.
- AUTO vs. DECIDE ripple classification — deciding whether a closing phase's pinned decision lands downstream mechanically or has to surface as a named follow-up is judgment-bearing by definition.
- Build-failure classification (coder / plan / environment) — the *routing* on each classification is deterministic; the classification itself is judgment.
- Human-facing reporting, and every criterion a human owes judgment on. A reviewer's product question must still reach the human; a deterministic loop must surface it, never swallow it.

## 4. Harness state of the art (as of 2026-08-25)

- **Claude Code** ships a workflow primitive: a deterministic script that spawns subagents, enforces JSON-schema structured outputs per agent call, supports sequential/parallel/pipelined composition, journals execution, and resumes from the journal. Everything §2 needs exists today on this harness.
- **Codex CLI** ships native *subagents* — a spawn/wait/close lifecycle plus custom agent definitions at `.codex/agents/*.toml`, the shape this repo already uses for its four role mirrors — but **no workflow-program primitive**. Orchestration across those subagents is model-driven: the vendor documentation has Codex itself handling "orchestration across agents, including spawning new subagents, routing follow-up instructions, waiting for results, and closing agent threads." There is no per-call schema enforcement and no resume-from-journal, so a deterministic path there remains external scripting (the Agents SDK) rather than a harness primitive.

Read that second bullet precisely, because it is the one a future session is most likely to misread: **subagent spawning is not the trigger.** Codex gained subagents between this brief's first draft and its 2026-08-25 re-check, and the deferral did not move — what §2 needs is a deterministic *control plane* (a script that holds the loop, the caps, and the routing), not the ability to delegate work to a child agent, which the prose loop already does.

This asymmetry is the blocker. One canonical `kickoff` has to drive both harnesses; a deterministic path that exists on one harness only is acceptable **only** in the shape cross-harness review already proved out: a config-gated enhancement with graceful fallback to the prose path, where the canonical contract stays in the entry and its linked resources.

## 5. Design sketch (tentative — to be re-validated at implementation time)

- The compact `SKILL.md` entry and its seven adjacent resources remain the **canonical contract**: `preflight.md`, `dispatch.md`, `planning.md`, `implementation.md`, `acceptance.md`, `close.md` and `recovery.md`. The entry names when each must be read; the resources own the steps, policy bindings and END format. The workflow program is an *implementation* of that contract, not a second authority.
- The program lives at a well-known repo path (e.g., `workflow/kickoff` in whatever format the harness requires) and is activated by a Project Context token — e.g., `deterministic-orchestration: enabled` — resolved in a Step 0b: token enabled **and** the current harness has the primitive → program path; otherwise → prose path, silently.
- Step granularity maps 1:1 to today's Steps 0a–10, so the END block, LOG discipline, and status-marker transitions are byte-identical regardless of path. A human reading `LOG.md` cannot tell which path ran except by the venue/path line that reports it.
- Verdicts move to the structured-output schema in the program path. **Open question (greenfield rule):** if the schema becomes the real contract, the prose path and the role files should adopt the same shape at the same time — one verdict contract everywhere, not a compat split. That migration touches `four-canonical-agents.md`, both reviewer role files, and `role-models.md`'s three-signal gate, and must land in the same phase that lands the program.
- **Drift guard:** a parity check (same family as `cross-harness-parity.md`'s verification sweep) asserting the program's step graph matches `SKILL.md`'s step list — mechanically extractable from both sides. Without this, prose and program *will* diverge silently; the guard is a precondition, not a nice-to-have.

## 6. Decision criteria — when to take this out of draft

Implement when **all** of:

1. **Codex (or whatever the second supported harness is) ships a workflow-parity *program* primitive** — a user-authored deterministic script that drives the loop, with per-call schema-enforced outputs and journal-backed resume. Native subagents alone do **not** satisfy this (§4). This is the trigger this brief waits on.
2. Both harnesses' primitives can express the `role-models.md` fallback state machine and the review-lane escalation path — the two most stateful parts of the loop.
3. The drift guard (§5) has a concrete mechanical design.
4. Re-validation of §4: harness APIs churn; §4 describes 2026-08-25 reality and must be re-checked, not trusted. Re-check history: 2026-06-09 (first draft), 2026-08-25 (briefs sweep — trigger had not fired).

Until then, the prose loop stands — the field evidence says it is executing faithfully, so there is no urgency, only an improving cost/robustness trade to claim when parity arrives.

## 7. Risks

- **Two sources of truth.** The central hazard; mitigated only by the drift guard and by keeping `SKILL.md` canonical.
- **Harness API churn.** A program path breaks louder than prose when the primitive's API moves. The config gate plus silent prose fallback bounds the blast radius.
- **Mid-loop human steering.** Plan-reviewer escalations (`AskUserQuestion`) and pause-mid-phase must survive the program path. If the primitive cannot surface a human question mid-run, the program must end the run with the question as its result — never answer it itself.
- **Debugging opacity.** A prose orchestrator narrates; a program journals. Acceptance for the implementing phase must include a failure-injection demo (kill a reviewer mid-call, malform a verdict) showing the journal tells the human what happened at least as clearly as today's END blocks.
