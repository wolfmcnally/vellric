# Standing Up a New Project From This Template

## Primary ownership and independent advice

As of 2026-09-07, the primary use case is a configured SOTA instance that owns orchestration, planning, implementation and acceptance. A comparable or stronger model in another permitted provider's harness normally supplies independent plan and code advice; a single-provider environment uses fresh instances of the primary model. One comprehensive pass per stage is normal, a second needs recorded cause, and two is the maximum. Advisers report evidence and severity without veto; the primary decides corrections and records consequential dispositions. Objective requirements and both close gates remain binding.

A constrained primary uses separate planner/coder roles and the established approval-gated reviewer/critic loops. Detailed references to mandatory reviewer approval or four-role delegation below describe that constrained product branch. Eligibility is maintained configuration, not a benchmark claim. Backend and handling restrictions prevail over preferred routing. Optional kickoff usage checks refuse a primary at >=95% of any applicable limit and substitute the primary for a secondary above 95% weekly; absent tooling does not prevent execution.

All methodology work itself, including teach/learn knowledge transfer, is always one-shot by the invoking primary across harnesses and capability tiers, without delegated production or independent review. The primary owns adaptation, self-checks, required gates, commit and fast-forward push within authorized scope. This standing delivery grant does not expand scope or waive custody and human decisions. No product phase or repeated approval ceremony is needed for authorized methodology work.


How to use this repository as a *master template* to bootstrap a new project that follows the same agentic coding methodology. This brief is the contract `stamp` implements; read it before customizing the skill or running the procedure by hand.

This brief assumes you already have (or are about to write) a high-level brief for the new project. If you don't yet have one, do the methodology's steps 1–3 first ([`methodology.md`](methodology.md)) — turn the idea into insights, write a brief, decide an architecture.

---

## Seed briefs

A real brief is the best input to `stamp`. It gives the bootstrap enough information to identify the project's users, purpose, surfaces, dependencies, constraints, and major phases. A one-line description is useful for an experiment, but it usually yields only a starter brief and the first phase.

The brief does not need to begin as a formal specification. A person can write it directly, or ask an AI chatbot or coding harness to interview them about the project and turn the answers into Markdown. Unknowns belong in the brief as open questions rather than guesses.

To adopt a seed, `stamp` accepts a destination containing only:

- an optional `.git/` directory and `.gitignore`;
- Markdown files at the top level; and
- a `briefs/` directory containing only Markdown files.

Source code, package manifests, archives, and other unrelated files make the destination ineligible. `stamp` refuses and names those files instead of merging a template into an existing project by accident.

`briefs/BRIEF.md` is the entry point when present. If there is exactly one brief, it keeps its name and becomes the entry point. When several briefs exist without `BRIEF.md`, `stamp` asks which one leads. Top-level Markdown briefs move under `briefs/`, except an existing `README.md`, which stays in place.

`stamp` may add required frontmatter, but it does not rewrite the body of an adopted brief. It reads configuration and the major-phase roadmap from the brief, asks only about missing decisions, and verifies afterward that the original body is unchanged. An explicit one-line description on the `stamp` command wins when it conflicts with the seed because it is the newer statement of intent; the final report names the override.

## 1. What gets transferred

A project derived from this template contains the following **portable structure**. Names and paths are load-bearing — don't rename them.

**Status legend** used in `plan/INDEX.md` and nowhere else:

```text
⏳ Not Started    ⬅️ Next (at most one)    🚧 In Progress    ✅ Completed
```

Every phase row carries exactly one recognized status. The initial idle ledger has exactly one `⬅️`; active and complete ledgers may have zero; more than one is always invalid.

**The four canonical agents** — exact names matter; `kickoff` invokes them by name:

| Role            | Tools allowed                                          | Writes code |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `phase-planner` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch                  | No          |
| `plan-reviewer` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch                  | No          |
| `phase-coder`   | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebFetch          | Yes         |
| `code-critic`   | Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch                             | No          |

The `kickoff` skill is itself **also** an agent in spirit, but it behaves as a user-invoked workflow, not a subagent. It delegates initial implementation to the four roles above and edits `plan/INDEX.md` + `LOG.md`; for a small low-risk follow-up correction, it may edit code directly under the proportional routing rule in `policies/review-lanes.md`.

## 2. What to transfer verbatim, what to rewrite, what to discard

The template's contents fall into three categories.

### 2a. Transfer essentially verbatim (universal)

These files encode the methodology itself, not any particular product. Copy them; replace any "Agentic Coding Starter Template" project-name references with the new project's name. Otherwise leave the structure intact.

- `.claude/skills/kickoff/` in full: `SKILL.md` plus `preflight.md`, `dispatch.md`, `planning.md`, `implementation.md`, `acceptance.md`, `close.md` and `recovery.md`
- `.claude/skills/methodology/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/rule-one/SKILL.md` (universal diagnostic-learning workflow; travels atomically with its reasoning brief)
- `.claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md` (universal cross-repo skill)
- `.claude/skills/teach/SKILL.md` (universal cross-repo skill)
- `.claude/skills/roles/SKILL.md` (universal — per-role model/effort editing; wraps `bin/kickoff-config`)
- `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md` (universal rule-surface maintenance and lessons graduation)
- `.claude/skills/sweep-planning/SKILL.md` (universal longitudinal sweep of plan-review verdicts harvested from harness traces; canonical home of the shared sweep lifecycle)
- `.claude/skills/sweep-coding/SKILL.md` (the same sweep over code-review verdicts and coder failure analyses)
- `.claude/skills/demo/SKILL.md` (universal one-step-at-a-time user demonstration workflow)
- `.claude/skills/treatise/SKILL.md` (universal publication-gated long-form synthesis; governed by `policies/treatise.md`)
- `.claude/skills/plain/SKILL.md` (universal operator register; governs every message addressed to the operator)
- `.claude/skills/ask/SKILL.md` (universal operator-invoked inventory of open decisions; never model-triggered)
- `.claude/settings.json` (portable harness defaults; `worktree.bgIsolation: none` disables implicit background worktrees without disabling explicit ones)
- `.claude/agents/phase-planner.md`
- `.claude/agents/plan-reviewer.md`
- `.claude/agents/phase-coder.md`

- `.agents/skills/sweep-coding` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/sweep-coding`)
- `.agents/skills/demo` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/demo`)
- `.agents/skills/treatise` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/treatise`)
- `.agents/skills/plain` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/plain`)
- `.agents/skills/ask` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/ask`)
- `AGENTS.md` symlink → `CLAUDE.md`
- Every file under `policies/` (these are universal by design)
- `docs/README.md` — the pinned-document catalog shape (header and column contract) with every row dropped; pinned content is project state and never transfers
- `policies/test-suite-governance.md` and `briefs/test-suite-value-governance.md` (the universal proof-estate contract; recipient-local values are generated later)
- `bin/kickoff-config` (universal Python/uv round-trip config manager, fail-closed venue preflight, execution watchdog, research-budget authority, and telemetry calibrator), plus human-editable `kickoff.yaml` seeded via `bin/kickoff-config reset all`
- `tests/test_kickoff_config.py` (universal manager/watchdog behavioral coverage; run independently of the deliverable's language)
- `bin/kickoff-tree-id` and `bin/kickoff-evidence` (universal candidate identity and run-evidence managers)
- `tests/test_kickoff_tree_id.py` and `tests/test_kickoff_evidence.py` (universal behavioral coverage for candidate/evidence mechanics)
- `bin/kickoff-command-zero`, `bin/check-log`, `bin/check-log-prefix`, `bin/check-log-monotonic`, `bin/log-append`, `bin/log-relocate`, and `bin/normalize-final-newline`, together with `lib/agentic_starter/candidate_boundaries.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/kickoff_runbook.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/workflow.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/advisory.py`, and `lib/agentic_starter/log_blocks.py` (the universal executable-authority, dual-identity, append-only log, and bounded-repair control plane)
- `tests/test_kickoff_control_plane.py` and `tests/test_log_control_plane.py` (behavioral coverage for exact command admission, command zero, log custody, and the single-repair boundary)
- `bin/check-receipt` and `tests/test_check_receipt.py` (universal durable full-gate records and exact, fail-closed pre-push reuse)
- `bin/test-governance`, `lib/agentic_starter/test_governance.py`, `tests/test_test_governance.py`, `tests/test_pre_commit.py`, and `reports/test-governance/README.md` (universal proof-estate mechanics and behavioral contract; the destination supplies its own manifest, assay cases, and report bodies)
- `bin/lessons` and `bin/check-catalogs` (universal lessons-ledger, document-link, and phase-ledger fitness managers)
- `tests/test_lessons.py` and `tests/test_check_catalogs.py` (universal behavioral coverage for those managers)
- `bin/execution-telemetry`, `bin/check-execution-dashboards`, and `bin/serve-execution-dashboard`, together with `lib/agentic_starter/` (the shared deterministic library the first two import) and `reports/execution/` with its `index.html`, `index-data.js`, and vendored offline `assets/`. The new project's archive starts empty, which the checker reports as `EXECUTION DASHBOARDS PASS (0 phases)`
- `tests/test_execution_telemetry.py`, `tests/test_execution_dashboard.py`, `tests/render_execution_dashboard_fixture.py`, and `tests/fixtures/` (universal behavioral coverage for telemetry and offline report rendering)
- `bin/check-harness-parity`, `bin/check-toolchain-callers`, `bin/check-shell-syntax`, `bin/new-name`, `bin/check-plan-concreteness` (which `kickoff` runs over every plan artifact before plan review, covered by `tests/test_check_plan_concreteness.py`), `bin/check-plan-delivery` (which `kickoff` runs before every code review, covered by `tests/test_check_plan_delivery.py`; both share `lib/agentic_starter/plan_artifact.py`), `bin/review-verdicts` (the `sweep-planning` / `sweep-coding` trace harvester, covered by `tests/test_review_verdicts.py`), and `bin/treatise` (the universal deterministic checkers and the ledger-slug generator), with `tests/test_mirror_parity.py`, `tests/test_toolchain_callers.py`, `tests/test_shell_syntax.py`, `tests/test_new_name.py`, and `tests/test_treatise.py`
- `tests/test_research_authority.py` (universal coverage for the per-role search/retrieval boundary)
- `.gitattributes` (line-ending normalization that keeps cross-harness mirrors byte-identical across platforms)
- `briefs/methodology.md`
- `briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md` (Rule One's portable diagnostic rationale; required companion to its skill)
- `briefs/agentic-bootstrap.md` (this file, so the next bootstrap is possible)
- `briefs/cross-agent-invocation.md` (the cross-CLI invocation BCPs cited by `policies/role-models.md`)
- `briefs/incremental-orchestration.md` (candidate-bound review, revision, verification, and protocol-recovery design)
- `briefs/deterministic-orchestration-control-plane.md` (implemented command authority, venue qualification, dual identity, log custody, and bounded repair design)
- `briefs/deterministic-orchestration.md` (draft universal brief: decision criteria for a deterministic kickoff loop, so the derived project can act when its harnesses gain parity workflow primitives)
- `briefs/harness-self-improvement.md` (phase-scale lessons capture, rule-surface pruning, and cross-repo propagation)
- `briefs/session-context-compaction.md` (managing harness context compaction during long orchestration runs)
- `briefs/mini-method.md` (the minimal subset a derived project can hand to its own small sub-projects; such a sub-project graduates back through `teach`)
- `briefs/test-suite-value-governance.md` (proof attribution, recipient-local assays, and governed fast-feedback lanes)
- The skeletal headings/structure of `plan/INDEX.md`
- The skeletal frontmatter shape for `plan/phase-*.md` (`id`, `title`, `depends_on`, `informs`, optional `review_lane` per `policies/review-lanes.md`)
- The START/END block format for `LOG.md`
- The status-marker convention (⏳ ⬅️ 🚧 ✅)

### 2b. Transfer the *shape*, rewrite the *content* (per-project)

These files have a stable shape and a project-specific body. Mirror the shape; write fresh content from the new project's brief.

- `README.md` — preserve the front-door job, not an exhaustive inventory. Write project-specific sections that tell a human reader what the project is, why it exists, who made or maintains it when the source material supplies that fact, how the methodology works at a high level, how to get started through `kickoff`, which other skills are essential, where the essential directories lead, and where the full documentation lives. Do not reproduce catalogs, status protocol, role tool matrices, or harness-mirror mechanics in the README; link to their authoritative homes. Judge completeness by what the newcomer needs to understand and act, not by whether every repository member appears. Never invent missing authorship or copy the Starter Kit author's identity into a derived project.
- `CLAUDE.md` — uses a two-zone structure delimited by HTML comment markers, with a **Hard rules** section above both. The `Methodology Contract` zone (between `<!-- METHODOLOGY_CONTRACT_START -->` and `<!-- METHODOLOGY_CONTRACT_END -->`) is copied verbatim — methodology briefs catalog, policies catalog, universal repo layout, phase-work protocol, status markers, reading protocol, architectural invariants, activity-log contract, universal conventions, glossary — **except for the starter-only members its catalogs name**. That zone lists what exists in *this* repository, so any entry pointing at a file the new project will not have (today: the `anonymize-log-references.md` policy bullet, and the `check-anonymization.sh` clause in the `bin/` layout bullet) comes out; left in, it is a `CLAUDE.md` reference to a missing file, which `bin/check-catalogs` fails closed on. The Hard rules section above the zones drops **Hard rule 3**, the starter-only anonymization rule, and the sentence introducing the rules is repaired to say the two survivors are universal. The `Project Context` zone (between `<!-- PROJECT_CONTEXT_START -->` and `<!-- PROJECT_CONTEXT_END -->`) is rewritten for the new project — the project's thesis, project-specific briefs list, project surfaces description, project conventions, and any project-specific skills.
- `briefs/BRIEF.md` — the entry-point brief for the new project. Pick a shape:
  - **Thesis-stub.** One short paragraph plus a pointer to `../CLAUDE.md#project-briefs`. Use when the project will quickly grow many topic briefs.
  - **Full single-document brief.** Opens with thesis + a catalog pointer, then continues with the long-form spec under H2 sections. Use when the project's brief is comprehensive and fits in one document. In both shapes the catalog itself lives in `CLAUDE.md`, not here.
- `briefs/<topic>.md` — written from the new project's spec, when the project is using the multi-file shape.
- `plan/INDEX.md` body — phase graph and table reflect the new project's phasing.
- `tests/proof-estate.yaml`, `tests/fixtures/test_governance/`, and `reports/test-governance/` bodies — preserve the universal schema and README, but generate every family, selector, tier, timing, assay case, and judgment from the new project's own proof inventory.
- `plan/phase-1.md` — fresh, project-specific. (Do not pre-build phases 2+. Decompose them when they become the next phase.)

### 2c. Do not transfer (template-specific)

- `.claude/skills/stamp/SKILL.md` — the new project doesn't need to stamp out more projects from itself, unless it explicitly wants to be a template too. (Note: `learn` and `teach` *are* carried over — they are universal cross-repo skills, not starter-specific.)
- `.agents/skills/stamp` — same reason. The starter-only `stamp` skill is intentionally absent from Codex's native skill discovery in derived projects.
- The starter template's own `plan/phase-1.md` (which is a placeholder for "decide what you're building") — replace it entirely with the new project's real Phase 1.
- The starter template's `example/` Python package and `tests/test_cli.py` — replace with the new project's surface, in whatever language(s) the project uses.
- `policies/anonymize-log-references.md`, `bin/check-anonymization.sh`, and `bin/anonymization-denylist.local.example` — starter-only: the rule exists because *this* template is public, not because of any methodology principle. Also drop the `bin/anonymization-denylist.local` line from the copied `.gitignore`, delete the `### check-anonymization.sh` entry from `bin/README.md`, remove its call from `bin/check`, and delete the "External / private-repo references" bullet from the copied `.claude/agents/code-critic.md`, which names both.
- `tests/test_methodology_toolchain_contract.py` — asserts on the `stamp` skill and the anonymization policy, neither of which the new project has.
- Starter's `tests/proof-estate.yaml`, `tests/fixtures/test_governance/corpus.yaml`, `tests/fixtures/test_governance/{historical_defect,holdout_mutant}/`, and generated files under `reports/test-governance/` — these are local inventory, effectiveness, reset, and assay state, not methodology content.
- `briefs/eacp-pattern-map.md`, `briefs/astra-era-development.md` and `briefs/methodology-treatise.md` — local pattern evidence, workflow-upgrade authority and outward explanation for this repository. A derived project writes its own if it wants them.
- `LICENSE` and `.vscode/` — the new repository's licensing and editor settings belong to whoever owns it.
- Every pinned document under this repository's `docs/` and every row of its `docs/README.md` catalog — pins are the template's own dependencies, not the new project's. The catalog file itself transfers with its header and no rows.
- This repository's `lessons/`, `lessons-archived/`, `user-actions/`, and `user-actions-archived/` entries — every ledger starts empty, with only a `.gitkeep` in each of the four so the directories survive the first commit.

If in doubt, ask: "does this file describe the methodology or a universally useful agentic capability, or does it describe the template itself?" Methodology and universal-capability files transfer; template-specific files don't.

**And prefer copying to omitting.** The list above is the whole set that stays behind; everything else under the universal surfaces travels. An unnecessary extra file in the new project is a nuisance that the next `sweep` removes. A missing one is a gate that will not start — `bin/check` fails closed on the first executable it cannot find, before it runs a single check.

---

## 3. The bootstrap procedure

The procedure assumes a directory has been named (or will be created) and a one-line description of the new project exists. If both are unavailable, ask the human before proceeding.

Bootstrap order matters: each step assumes the previous one's outputs.

### Step 1 — Confirm the project's identity and one-line thesis

Before touching files, write down (in conversation, not a file):

- **The canonical project name.** Camel-case, capitalization rules, ASCII symbol if different from the brand. Treat this as a placeholder until Step 2 vets it; failures send you back here to reconsider.
- **A one-sentence thesis.** "A daily palindromic-sentence word game"; "a recipe-first audio asset compiler"; "a small CLI that fetches the time from an NTP server."
- **The primary surfaces** the project will have (web front-end + back-end + IaC; pure Python CLI + library; mobile app + API; pure documentation; etc.).

These three pieces drive the rest of the bootstrap. Anchor them in `CLAUDE.md` first thing in Step 4.

### Step 2 — Brand-check the project name (when commercially relevant)

For personal projects, prototypes, or internal tools, skip to Step 3. For projects that may grow public, the name in the brief is a *placeholder* until this check passes.

Check, in this order:

1. **Domain availability.** `<name>.com` first; project-relevant TLDs second (`.io`, `.dev`, `.app`, plus one domain-relevant one such as `.audio` for an audio tool). For compound names, also check bare-noun and word-swap variants.
2. **Software-ecosystem collisions.** Search PyPI, npm, crates.io, GitHub (sort by stars), Homebrew, Linux distros, for the name and near-variants. A tool with the same name in an unrelated space is usually tolerable; a tool with the same name in an *adjacent* space is a hard collision.
3. **Trademark / commercial signals** (when commercial intent exists). USPTO TESS or EUIPO lookup. Skip for purely personal projects.
4. **In-context web search.** Query the name with adjacent-space keywords to surface social-media handles, blog properties, indie projects living below the bare-name search.

Pass criteria (all must hold): no active product or site in adjacent space; no popular GitHub repo using the same name; no package on the ecosystems your project will publish to; no trademark in adjacent space if commercial intent.

Failure protocol: stop. Propose 5–10 alternatives with collision summaries. Once the human picks, update the brief's title and any in-line references to the placeholder name before any file is committed under that name. Renaming pre-commit is cheap; renaming a working project is expensive.

### Step 3 — Initialize git and lay down the directory skeleton

`git init` first if the directory is not already a git repo. The methodology relies on `git status` and `git log` for several invariants (the orchestrator's "files touched" detection, blame-aware reads, the build-gate's surface inference); without a git repo those quietly fall back to broken behavior.

Then write `.gitignore` from a language-appropriate template plus the methodology's own entries:

```gitignore
# Agentic system runtime state
.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock
.claude/settings.local.json
.claude/projects/
.codex/cache/
.kickoff/
```

Do not gitignore the `.claude/` or `.codex/` *directories* themselves — the skill and agent definitions are committed source. Only runtime state is ignored.

Then create the empty directory shape:

```text
.claude/skills/kickoff/  # SKILL.md plus seven adjacent resources listed in Step 5
.claude/skills/methodology/
.claude/skills/rule-one/
.claude/skills/learn/
.claude/skills/teach/
.claude/skills/roles/
.claude/skills/sweep/
.claude/skills/sweep-planning/
.claude/skills/sweep-coding/
.claude/skills/demo/
.claude/skills/treatise/
.claude/skills/plain/
.claude/skills/ask/
.claude/agents/
.codex/agents/
.agents/skills/        # (the thirteen skill entries here are directory symlinks
                       #  to ../../.claude/skills/<name>, created in Step 5)
briefs/
docs/
lessons/
lessons-archived/
policies/
plan/
```

Plus directories for the project's primary language skeleton (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `web/`, etc.).

### Step 4 — Author the top-level files

In this exact order (each feeds the next):

1. **`briefs/BRIEF.md`** — the entry-point brief. Pick the thesis-stub or full-single-document shape from §2b. In both shapes, the catalog itself lives in `CLAUDE.md`, not here.

2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — top-level guidance. The template's `CLAUDE.md` ships with a two-zone structure. Bootstrap consists of:
   - Copying the template's `CLAUDE.md` as a whole, including the introductory paragraph that documents the two-zone contract.
   - Leaving the **Methodology Contract** zone (between `<!-- METHODOLOGY_CONTRACT_START -->` and `<!-- METHODOLOGY_CONTRACT_END -->`) verbatim. This contains: methodology briefs list, full policies catalog, universal repo layout, phase work + kickoff skill section, status markers, reading protocol, architectural invariants, activity log contract, universal conventions, glossary.
   - Rewriting the **Project Context** zone (between `<!-- PROJECT_CONTEXT_START -->` and `<!-- PROJECT_CONTEXT_END -->`) for the new project. The Project Context zone uses these sections:
     - `# Project Context` header
     - `## This Repo is <Project>` — canonical spelling, one-sentence thesis, pointer to `briefs/BRIEF.md`.
     - `## Project briefs` — `briefs/` entries specific to this project (initially `BRIEF.md` only).
     - `## Project surfaces` — the deliverable (location, language, seed code description).
     - `## Project conventions` — language, tooling, build-gate command shape.
     - `## Project-specific skills` — any beyond the universal thirteen. Omit if none.

3. **`AGENTS.md`** — symlink to `CLAUDE.md`:
   ```bash
   ln -s CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md
   ```
   Codex and aider read `AGENTS.md`; Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; the symlink keeps both honest from a single source.

4. **`LOG.md`** — create as a one-line stub:
   ```markdown
   # Activity Log
   ```
   `kickoff` will append the first START block.

5. **`README.md`** — didactic top-level for human readers. Apply the front-door contract in section 2b with project-specific content. If the seed carried a README, keep the user's text and add only the missing orientation, getting-started, essential-map, and documentation-guide material. The README is the human's entry point; CLAUDE.md is the agent's.

### Step 5 — Port the universal harness bundle

Copy verbatim, then adapt project names and surface-specific build-gate commands:

- `.claude/skills/kickoff/` in full: `SKILL.md` plus `preflight.md`, `dispatch.md`, `planning.md`, `implementation.md`, `acceptance.md`, `close.md` and `recovery.md`
- `.claude/skills/methodology/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/rule-one/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/teach/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/roles/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/sweep-planning/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/sweep-coding/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/demo/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/treatise/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/plain/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/ask/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.claude/agents/phase-planner.md`
- `.claude/agents/plan-reviewer.md`
- `.claude/agents/phase-coder.md`
- `.claude/agents/code-critic.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- `.agents/skills/{kickoff,methodology,rule-one,learn,teach,roles,sweep,sweep-planning,sweep-coding,demo,treatise,plain,ask}` (directory symlinks → `../../.claude/skills/<name>`)

Port Rule One as one atomic methodology unit:

- `.claude/skills/rule-one/SKILL.md`
- `briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md`
- `.agents/skills/rule-one` (directory symlink → `../../.claude/skills/rule-one`)

The destination may not contain only the skill or only the brief.

Port the self-improvement machinery as the same atomic bundle:

- `briefs/harness-self-improvement.md`
- `policies/lessons.md`
- `bin/lessons` and `bin/check-catalogs`
- `tests/test_lessons.py` and `tests/test_check_catalogs.py`
- empty `lessons/` and `lessons-archived/` directories, each retained by a `.gitkeep`

Do not seed a new project's ledger with the template's lesson entries. Ledger content is project state; only the schema, empty directories, capture loop, and fitness checks transfer.

Port the deterministic orchestration control plane as one atomic bundle:

- `briefs/deterministic-orchestration-control-plane.md` and `policies/orchestration-control-plane.md`
- `bin/kickoff-command-zero`, `bin/check-log`, `bin/check-log-prefix`, `bin/check-log-monotonic`, `bin/log-append`, `bin/log-relocate`, and `bin/normalize-final-newline`
- `lib/agentic_starter/candidate_boundaries.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/kickoff_runbook.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/workflow.py`, `lib/agentic_starter/advisory.py`, and `lib/agentic_starter/log_blocks.py`
- `tests/test_kickoff_control_plane.py` and `tests/test_log_control_plane.py`
- its `kickoff-evidence`, `kickoff-config`, `kickoff-tree-id`, `bin/check`, pre-commit, catalog, and skill integrations

The destination regenerates its own exact command manifest, selector dry-runs, venue set, inert bookkeeping vocabulary, and proof-estate admissions. Copying the template's local values would turn examples into authority.

The executable transfer skills, this manual procedure, its acceptance checklist, the methodology narrative, role-output contracts, catalogs, and contract tests form one propagation boundary. Whenever a universal bundle grows, update every path in the same change; leaving one path stale makes derived repositories depend on which bootstrap procedure happened to run.

Adaptations to make in each:

- Replace `Agentic Coding Starter Template` (and any short-name like `Starter`) with the new project name throughout.
- Replace the template's example surface paths (`example/`, `tests/`) in build-gate command lists with the new project's surfaces. The template's polyglot pattern (lint command + format command + test command) is a template — keep the surfaces that apply, drop the rest, add new ones (e.g., a Rust package, a TypeScript front-end, IaC) as the project requires.
- Replace template-specific brief references with the new project's analogues, or remove them if no analogue exists.
- Keep the **structural elements verbatim**: step numbering, agent invocation order, status-marker semantics, verdict headers (`## Verdict: APPROVED` / `## Verdict: REVISE`), output schemas. These are the contract between the four roles; changing them silently breaks orchestration.

### Step 6 — Port every file under `policies/`

Policies are universal by design. Copy them verbatim; replace any `Agentic Coding Starter Template` references with the new project name. Add new policy files only when the new project genuinely needs a rule the template doesn't have.

### Step 7 — Stand up `plan/INDEX.md`

The spine. Lay it down before any phase files exist:

- `# Phased Execution Plan — <Project>` heading.
- One-paragraph statement of what `plan/` covers and what it doesn't.
- `## Reading protocol` — copy from template, lightly adapted.
- `## Phase Dependency Graph` — a Mermaid `graph TD` block. At bootstrap, enumerate every major phase surfaced by the brief; add authorized child nodes just in time.
- `## Phase Table` — the canonical status ledger. Columns: `Phase | Title | Status`. Initially:

  ```markdown
  | [Phase 1](phase-1.md) | <First-phase title> | ⬅️ |
  ```

  Status markers live only here.
- `## Cross-Cutting Concerns` — the project's invariants, mirrored from `CLAUDE.md`'s "Architectural invariants" section. Keep the two lists in sync.
- `## Critical-Files Map` — table of "concern → location." Initially sparse; populated as the project takes shape.
- `## Decomposition ledger (convention)` — the typed-note vocabulary (deferred-work notes, protocol notes, phase launch gates, insertion/renumbering records with the append-only decoder-ring rule, slice-outcome notes) copied from the template's `plan/INDEX.md`. Empty at bootstrap; it is where the plan's own history accumulates as dated, operator-attributed prose.

### Step 8 — Write Phase 1 in full; sketch Phase 2+ to general specificity

Write Phase 1 in full, then sketch every other major phase the brief surfaces. Major phases are enumerated up front — that's the project's roadmap. Children are conditional: apply the outcome-boundary test in `.claude/skills/kickoff/preflight.md` Step 1a; draft authorized children just in time. See [`methodology.md`](methodology.md) §6.

`plan/phase-1.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: "1"
title: "<First-phase title>"
depends_on: []
informs: []        # filled in as later phases are added
---
```

Body sections, in order:

- **Goal** — one paragraph. What the user can do or observe at the end of Phase 1 that they cannot do now.
- **Decomposition** — keep a coherent outcome intact across modules, tests and docs. A consequential decision, independently accepted prerequisite, deployment/migration/human seam or demonstrated coherence limit may justify an operator-approved split. Missing children, surface counts, session length and model reputation do not. If no boundary applies, declare a coherent major phase with no children; otherwise leave child drafting to kickoff at entry.
- **Phase-level acceptance** — concrete, empirical, observable.
- **Brief refs** — links to every brief under `briefs/` that this phase implements.

Sub-phase files (`plan/phase-1.1.md`, etc.) follow the same frontmatter shape with `id: "1.1"` and `depends_on: ["1"]` (or sibling sub-phases). Bodies: Goal / Deliverables / Acceptance / Brief refs. Do not draft child files at bootstrap. Once a boundary is authorized, kickoff drafts the first at parent entry and each successor at its predecessor’s close.

**Phase 2+ at bootstrap.** For every major phase the brief surfaces beyond Phase 1, draft a sketched `plan/phase-N.md` at lower fidelity:

- Frontmatter: same shape (`id`, `title`, `depends_on`, `informs`).
- **Goal** — one paragraph from the brief.
- **Deliverables** — a high-level list (the surfaces this phase will produce). May shift as upstream phases close and ripple their pinned decisions downstream — mechanical edits land in the same session, judgment-level ones surface as named follow-ups.
- **Acceptance** — scaffold-level criteria. Tighten at phase start via `.claude/skills/kickoff/preflight.md` Step 1a; pinned values from upstream phases ripple in automatically.
- **Brief refs** — links to the briefs this phase implements.

**Do not draft sub-phases of Phase 2+ at bootstrap.** Sub-phase decomposition is JIT, one parent at a time. The sketched parent file is enough; children appear only after a consequential boundary is authorized at entry.

If the brief surfaces only Phase 1 (a small, single-phase project), no sketches are required. The dependency graph in `plan/INDEX.md` then contains a single node.

### Step 9 — Lay down the project's primary code surface

The template's example is Python. The new project may be Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Swift, Kotlin, a polyglot, or pure documentation.

**Decide first whether to adopt the `project/` convention** — isolating the deliverable so that nothing inside it references anything above it. The default for a single-deliverable project is opt-in: the artifact goes under `project/` and the repository-owned toolchain wrappers select it internally. The default for polyglot or multi-deliverable repos is opt-out: deliverable directories live at the repo root as siblings.

Lay down (paths assume `project_isolation` enabled — prefix with `project/`; drop the prefix when disabled):

- The runtime/toolchain version declaration, package-manager file (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.), and lockfile with pinned tooling and minimum dependencies.
- A concise `README.md` for the artifact (self-contained, no `..` references).
- The package directory with empty modules.
- The test directory with one trivial test that passes (so the build gate has something to run on first kickoff).
- A `.gitignore` clause at the repo root for the language's build artifacts.

The repository owns setup, focused/full testing, runtime selection, authoritative gates, and durable full-gate receipts as one bundle. Generate `bin/setup`, `bin/test`, `bin/check`, and `bin/check-receipt` with the universal interface — cwd- and symlink-independent, atomic, and never inferring a runtime from the host `PATH`; add a runtime wrapper such as `bin/python` when appropriate. Back them with the target's version declaration, committed manifest, lockfile, and behavioral tests. A profile that permits an explicit runtime override treats it as authoritative: the override either passes a target-adapted dependency-chain load/run probe or the command fails without fallback. Default and override paths apply identical runtime selection to the probe and the real command. A mutable environment must reject an override that points inside itself, because synchronization may replace that interpreter while selecting it.

`bin/check` preserves `all|lint|format|test|policy` and delegates `test` to `bin/test`. Immutable ecosystem modes include `uv --locked --managed-python`, frozen Node installs, Cargo `--locked`, Go `-mod=readonly`, or their equivalent. Make `kickoff`, the canonical agents, CLAUDE.md, and phase acceptance use `./bin/test ...` for focused tests and `./bin/check all` for the full claim; callers do not duplicate the command mappings. Every `all` run captures a complete log and terminal metadata under the gitignored `.kickoff/check-all/` tree. A success receipt is bound to the exact candidate and environment fingerprint. The fingerprint is obtained through the repository-selected runtime path and records the implementation, actual version, resolved executable and base-executable identity and file digests, machine, platform, and package-manager version; it never substitutes the receipt helper's runtime or the declared version file. Candidate hashing stays separate and does not absorb a venv or external runtime tree. The pre-push hook reuses the receipt only for a clean current `HEAD`, and fails closed by running the full gate on every miss, descriptor failure, or query error.

Generate the recipient's proof estate only after its real tests, gates, and hooks exist. `bin/test-governance inventory` supplies the local baseline; `tests/proof-estate.yaml` then declares the recipient-local families and gate/hook surfaces. Freeze the whole baseline, run the local Pareto assay, physically remove dominated proofs, and disposition every baseline proof before adoption completes. Declare a size for every pytest family and a test-lane time budget measured on the recipient's own reference machine while retaining at least 80% historical and held-out recall and direct proof for every applicable critical risk. Park when those requirements cannot coexist. Do not copy the template's survivors, selectors, tiers, risk judgments, timings, assay cases, reports, or dispositions. Run `reassess` and `timing` during sweeps, and widen indeterminate changed selection to full. Policy and pre-commit validate structure; the changed-path selection is the implementation gate, and the handoff gate and pre-push remain full over the retained estate. The pinned environment includes the YAML parser.

**A non-Python deliverable makes this a two-runtime contract, not a one-line substitution.** The universal managers under `bin/` and the whole root `tests/` suite are Python, so a TypeScript, Rust, or Go project carries a second, committed governance environment — conventionally `tooling/`: runtime pin, manifest, lockfile, and no source of its own. Everything above then doubles. `bin/setup` provisions both from their lockfiles and probes both before reporting success. `bin/test` routes by path prefix — the deliverable's path to its own runner with the prefix stripped, `tests/...` to pytest — and refuses an invocation that mixes the two rather than guessing. `bin/check` splits `lint` and `format` per runtime while still emitting exactly one `CHECK <mode> PASS` line per mode, the way the policy lane emits one after its sub-gates. Each language gets a helper beside `bin/_python-toolchain` with the same contract — prerequisite check, contract members, an authoritative absolute-path override that never falls back, and a real dependency probe — and each helper takes its own root variable, because a single `project_root` no longer says enough. Pin the package manager in the manifest and invoke it through the launcher that honors the pin, so no caller depends on what happens to be installed. And pin the language version to what the *lint stack* supports rather than to the newest release: a type-checker release its linter has not adopted yet turns the lint gate into a load-time crash, which reads as a broken repository rather than as a version conflict.

### Step 10 — Sanity-check the bootstrap

Check the instruction capability as a whole: root at most 20480 UTF-8 bytes, kickoff entry at most 10240, the hard clauses and waiver intact, four unique ordered zone markers, and concise complete brief/policy/skill/role catalogs. Read the entry and all seven adjacent resources; verify direct live links and explicit read-before-branch instructions, including recovery and follow-ups, through both canonical and Codex directory paths. Directory transfer preserves relative link depth; update every actual consumer of moved sections. Structural reachability does not prove live loading or adherence. Local Astra authority and template docs pins remain excluded.


Before declaring the bootstrap complete, verify:

- `readlink AGENTS.md` returns `CLAUDE.md`.
- `bin/check-catalogs` accepts the initial idle ledger with exactly one `⬅️` and resolves every current-candidate internal Markdown link.
- `head -1 LOG.md` is `# Activity Log`.
- `ls .claude/agents/` lists exactly the four canonical role files.
- Each of `.claude/skills/{kickoff,methodology,rule-one,learn,teach,roles,sweep,sweep-planning,sweep-coding,demo,treatise,plain,ask}/` contains `SKILL.md`, and each corresponding `.agents/skills/<name>` entry is a directory symlink to `../../.claude/skills/<name>`.
- `briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md` exists alongside the Rule One skill.
- `bin/lessons validate`, `bin/check-catalogs`, and their behavioral tests pass against the empty initial ledger and Phase 1 status table.
- `bin/kickoff-config show` succeeds and `kickoff.yaml` contains valid `role_models`, `role_timeouts`, and `research_budgets` sections.
- `.claude/settings.json` sets `worktree.bgIsolation` to `none`; explicitly requested worktrees remain available.
- `bin/setup` works from outside the repository and provisions only the committed runtime and dependencies, then passes a real deliverable-and-tool dependency-chain probe.
- `bin/test` runs deliverable and universal tooling tests; a focused repo-relative selection runs only that selection.
- `bin/test-governance validate` and `bin/test-governance reassess` pass against a recipient-local frozen baseline, complete disposition ledger, both 20% ceilings, both 80% effectiveness floors, and direct applicable-risk proofs.
- `bin/check test` delegates to `bin/test` before any live venue probe.
- A valid explicit runtime override drives setup, probing, testing, gates, and the runtime wrapper; an invalid or probe-failing override exits nonzero without trying the repository default or an ambient runtime.
- The new `CLAUDE.md` catalogs are bidirectionally complete, and every tracked repository-internal Markdown link resolves.
- `plan/phase-1.md`'s `Brief refs` section lists at least one brief, and each listed brief exists.
- `bin/check all` runs from outside the repository root and passes on the trivial seeded code, including the universal methodology tests.
- A successful full gate leaves a verifiable candidate/environment receipt and complete log; dirty, changed, corrupt, non-`HEAD`, and query-error pre-push cases all run the full gate.

The first `kickoff` invocation should pick up Phase 1's `⬅️` row, flip it to `🚧`, and append a START block to `LOG.md`. If any of those three actions fails, the bootstrap is incomplete — a path mismatch or a missing skill is the typical culprit.

## 4. Per-project adaptation axes

The bootstrap is the same shape every time. The variation is in:

| Axis                          | Examples of project-specific choices                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surfaces**                  | web + back-end + IaC; pure Python lib; mobile + API; docs     |
| **Toolchain implementation**  | repository-owned setup/test/check/runtime bundle using pinned, locked ecosystem commands |
| **Languages in play**         | Python / TS / Rust / Go / Swift / Kotlin / polyglot           |
| **Deployment story**          | AWS / Cloudflare / Vercel / app stores / static / none        |
| **Per-project invariants**    | Cost ceilings; license policy; privacy boundaries; FOSS-only  |
| **Per-project skills**        | Domain-specific workflows on top of `kickoff`                |
| **Kickoff execution config** | Human-editable `kickoff.yaml`: separate model/effort fields, target-local timeout calibration, and per-role research budgets, per the role, timeout, and research-authority policies |

When adapting, edit these files (and only these) to reflect those choices:

- `CLAUDE.md` — reflects all of them.
- `plan/INDEX.md` Cross-Cutting Concerns — duplicates the invariants from `CLAUDE.md`.
- `bin/setup`, `bin/test`, `bin/check`, `bin/check-receipt`, runtime wrapper, version declaration, manifest, lockfile, and their behavioral tests — one atomic implementation.
- `.claude/skills/kickoff/` in full: `SKILL.md` plus `preflight.md`, `dispatch.md`, `planning.md`, `implementation.md`, `acceptance.md`, `close.md` and `recovery.md` and the four canonical agents — call the canonical focused/full mappings.
- `bin/kickoff-tree-id`, `bin/kickoff-evidence`, and `policies/orchestration-evidence.md` — preserve candidate-bound review, revision packets, implementation-final-gate evidence, and the separate post-bookkeeping handoff gate.

Anything else that needs to change probably indicates a bootstrap deviation that should be questioned, not normalized.

## 5. Common pitfalls

These bite every bootstrap; flag them before they happen.

- **Status markers in two places.** The status of a phase lives in `plan/INDEX.md`'s phase table and **nowhere else**. Per-phase frontmatter is `id / title / depends_on / informs` — no `status` field.
- **Document drift.** `CLAUDE.md`'s catalogs must be bidirectionally complete, and current-candidate internal Markdown links must resolve. Catalog membership alone does not prove that links inside transferred documents survived adaptation.
- **`AGENTS.md` as a real file instead of a symlink.** A duplicate file drifts. Make it a symlink and verify with `readlink`.
- **Reusing template-specific invariants.** "The example Python project must lint clean" is a template rule. Don't carry it into a project that has no Python.
- **Filling in Phase 2+ at bootstrap.** Tempting and wrong. Phase 1 reality is the input to Phase 2's design.
- **Agent name drift.** The four canonical roles must be named exactly `phase-planner`, `plan-reviewer`, `phase-coder`, `code-critic`. `kickoff` invokes them by name. A typo silently breaks the orchestrator's ability to delegate.
- **Editing `LOG.md` by hand.** History is owned by `kickoff`. If a phase pauses mid-way, `kickoff` writes the pause-reason END block; do not retroactively edit prior entries.
- **Skipping the brief.** The bootstrap assumes a brief exists. Bootstrapping into an empty `briefs/` produces scaffolding for a project nobody has decided yet — the orchestrator will plan against air.

## 6. Acceptance — "the new repo is ready for `kickoff`"

Bootstrap is complete when **all** of the following hold:

```text
[ ] Project name confirmed; brand check passed (if commercially relevant)
[ ] `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` returns true
[ ] `.gitignore` exists with language-appropriate entries plus the agentic
    runtime-state ignores
[ ] briefs/BRIEF.md exists in one of the two valid shapes (thesis-stub or
    full-spec-with-thesis-preamble) and references the catalog in CLAUDE.md
[ ] CLAUDE.md exists with all required sections (§3.4 above)
[ ] AGENTS.md is a symlink to CLAUDE.md
[ ] LOG.md exists and contains only `# Activity Log` and the contract paragraph
[ ] plan/INDEX.md exists with: graph block (enumerating every major phase
    the brief surfaces), status legend, phase table containing one row per
    major phase with exactly one row whose status is ⬅️ (Phase 1), cross-
    cutting concerns (mirroring CLAUDE.md), critical-files map
[ ] plan/phase-1.md exists in full, with frontmatter (id "1", depends_on []),
    Goal / Decomposition / Acceptance / Brief refs sections
[ ] plan/phase-N.md exists for every major phase N≥2 the brief surfaces,
    sketched to general specificity (frontmatter + Goal + high-level
    Deliverables + scaffold Acceptance + Brief refs). If the brief surfaces
    only Phase 1, no sketches are required.
[ ] Only the in-flight major phase has sub-phase files drafted, and only as
    many as `.claude/skills/kickoff/preflight.md` Step 1a and `.claude/skills/kickoff/close.md` Step 9a have produced so far. At bootstrap there are no child files. Authorized children are JIT; coherent major phases need none.
[ ] The complete .claude/skills/kickoff/ directory exists, entry and seven resources, adapted for this project’s
    surfaces and build gates
[ ] .claude/skills/methodology/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/rule-one/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] briefs/rule-one-diagnostic-learning.md exists and is compatible with the
    Rule One skill
[ ] .claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/teach/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/roles/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/sweep/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/sweep-planning/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/sweep-coding/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/demo/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/treatise/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/plain/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/ask/SKILL.md exists (verbatim from template)
[ ] .claude/skills/stamp/ does NOT exist (starter-only meta-skill)
[ ] .claude/agents/{phase-planner,plan-reviewer,phase-coder,code-critic}.md
    exist, adapted for this project
[ ] .codex/agents/*.toml mirrors exist
[ ] .agents/skills/{kickoff,methodology,rule-one,learn,teach,roles,sweep,sweep-planning,sweep-coding,demo,treatise,plain,ask} exist as directory
    symlinks to ../../.claude/skills/<name> (the canonical skill directory)
[ ] .agents/skills/stamp does NOT exist (starter-only, must not propagate)
[ ] .claude/settings.json sets worktree.bgIsolation to none while explicit
    worktrees remain available
[ ] bin/kickoff-config is executable; kickoff.yaml validates all three sections; scoped updates
    preserve human comments and `extensions` data; `.kickoff/` is gitignored
[ ] bin/kickoff-tree-id, bin/kickoff-evidence, and bin/kickoff-command-zero are
    executable; full-tree/product identity, immutable command admission,
    configuration-bound preflight receipts, and run-scoped evidence tests pass
[ ] bin/lessons and bin/check-catalogs are executable; a .gitkeep exists in
    each of lessons/, lessons-archived/, user-actions/, and
    user-actions-archived/, and none of the four carries an entry copied from
    the template; ledger, document-link, and phase-lifecycle fitness tests pass
[ ] Every executable bin/check requires is present and executable:
    kickoff-tree-id, kickoff-evidence, kickoff-config, check-receipt,
    execution-telemetry, check-execution-dashboards, check-harness-parity,
    check-toolchain-callers, test-governance, lessons, treatise, check-catalogs,
    check-hooks-installed, check-shell-syntax, new-name, check-log,
    check-log-prefix, check-log-monotonic, kickoff-command-zero, log-append,
    log-relocate, normalize-final-newline. bin/check fails closed
    on the first one missing, before any gate runs — this is the fastest way to
    catch an incomplete transfer
[ ] lib/agentic_starter/ exists (the telemetry, dashboard, plan-artifact, and
    test-governance managers import it); reports/execution/ carries
    index.html, index-data.js, and assets/, and
    bin/check-execution-dashboards reports 0 phases against the fresh archive
[ ] bin/check-harness-parity passes: one .agents/skills mirror per canonical
    skill, no orphans, one .codex/agents/*.toml per canonical role
[ ] policies/anonymize-log-references.md, bin/check-anonymization.sh, and
    tests/test_methodology_toolchain_contract.py do NOT exist, and no file in
    the new repo links or names them — including CLAUDE.md's Hard rules
    (rule 3 is gone) and its Policies catalog
[ ] bin/setup, bin/test, bin/check, bin/check-receipt, bin/test-governance,
    bin/install-hooks, and bin/check-hooks-installed are executable;
    the language runtime wrapper exists when applicable; .githooks/pre-push
    reuses only an exact verified receipt and otherwise calls bin/check; hook
    installation remains explicit and opt-in, with the opt-in-aware liveness
    witness in the check policy lane
[ ] Runtime version metadata, package manifest, and lockfile form a complete
    language profile; no workflow assumes a versioned runtime binary on PATH;
    setup, test, check, and the runtime wrapper route correctly through both
    single-hop and chained launch symlinks
[ ] For a non-Python deliverable: tooling/ carries a committed governance
    environment; bin/setup provisions and probes both runtimes; bin/test routes
    by path prefix and refuses an invocation spanning both suites; bin/check
    splits lint and format per runtime while still emitting one
    CHECK <mode> PASS line per mode; every language version pin sits inside the
    range its lint and type tooling support, with the constraint written down
[ ] tests/test_toolchain_entrypoints.py, tests/test_check.py,
    tests/test_check_receipt.py,
    tests/test_install_hooks.py, tests/test_check_hooks_installed.py,
    tests/test_kickoff_config.py,
    tests/test_kickoff_tree_id.py, tests/test_kickoff_evidence.py,
    tests/test_lessons.py, tests/test_check_catalogs.py,
    tests/test_treatise.py, tests/test_new_name.py, tests/test_shell_syntax.py,
    tests/test_toolchain_callers.py, tests/test_mirror_parity.py,
    tests/test_research_authority.py, tests/test_execution_telemetry.py, and
    tests/test_execution_dashboard.py, tests/test_test_governance.py, and
    tests/test_pre_commit.py pass through bin/test
[ ] tests/proof-estate.yaml and reports/test-governance/ contain only this
    project's inventory and evidence; bin/test-governance validate passes;
    every seeded proof is retained, and a full-only project needs no borrowed
    effectiveness corpus
[ ] Every file in policies/ from the template exists, with project-name
    references updated
[ ] No template-specific skills, briefs, or example code remain in the new
    repo (no example/, no .claude/skills/stamp/)
[ ] ./bin/check all runs from outside the repo and passes on the seeded code
[ ] First `kickoff` invocation (`/kickoff` in Claude Code; `$kickoff` in Codex)
    successfully picks up Phase 1's ⬅️ row,
    flips it to 🚧, and appends a START block to LOG.md
```

The last item is the operational test. Until it passes, the bootstrap is not done.

## 7. Pointers

- **The template (this repo) is itself the canonical donor.** Future versions of the bootstrap procedure should be updated *in the template first*, then propagated to derived projects' copies of `agentic-bootstrap.md` on next opportunity.
- **The methodology** is documented in [`methodology.md`](methodology.md) (sibling brief, copied verbatim into every derived project).
- **The cross-harness contract** is one canonical home per skill and role definition, with thin pointers from every other harness and a parity check that rejects a missing, copied, or orphaned mirror. Adding a third or fourth harness follows that contract rather than forking the definitions.


## Candidate declaration transfer

The candidate boundary transfers atomically: `candidate-partition.yaml`, `bin/check-candidate-partition`, `lib/agentic_starter/candidate_boundaries.py`, candidate/evidence managers, the staged hook, gate inventory, and their behavioral fixtures. Generate the recipient's explicit active inventory and retain only its approved bookkeeping exclusions; never copy the donor's path judgments. The declaration remains active, unclassified tracked files refuse, unclassified nonignored untracked files remain included, and complete-tree delivery receipts remain mandatory. Verify the staged checker by actually tripping it in an isolated fixture. The tiny supported YAML subset and pattern syntax are defined in `policies/orchestration-evidence.md`.

Workflow runtime transfer includes `lib/agentic_starter/workflow.py` and `lib/agentic_starter/advisory.py` with the configuration, evidence tools and behavioral fixtures. Recipient model/backend restrictions remain recipient-owned.
